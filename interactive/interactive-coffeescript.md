### 前言

* * * * * * * * * *


CoffeeScript 是 JavaScript 进化版，由Jeremy
Ashkenas创建. 本书参照了  Marijn Haverbeke 的 “机锋
JavaScript” . 除了将目标语言从JavaScript 变成 CoffeeScript, 还做了很多其它修改，章节上也有调整。

Everything that is expressed in this book is therefore solely the
responsibility of the editor. In the sense of open source software,
this book is a
[fork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)).
To read the excellent original JavaScript work as it was intended
by its author refer to [Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn
Haverbeke](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

You do not need to know JavaScript but after reading Smooth
CoffeeScript you can in [JavaScript
Basics](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/literate/js-intro.html)
by Rebecca Murphey find an overview that can be helpful when debugging
or using JavaScript libraries.

##### ○•○

The program examples in this book live in an interactive environment
where you can change the examples and create new solutions while
you learn CoffeeScript. The environment also includes the Underscore
functional library, the Coffeekup HTML markup, and `qc`, a QuickCheck
based testing library. These libraries extend CoffeeScript with
useful abstractions and testing tools to keep focus on the task at
hand instead of distracting boilerplate code.

While it is possible to express programs from a very small set of
language primitives, it quickly becomes tedious and error prone to
do so. The approach taken here is to include a broader set of
functional building blocks as if they were a native part of the
programming language. By thinking in terms of these higher level
constructs more complex problems can be handled with less effort.

To ensure correctness testing is required. This is especially true
when developing reusable algorithms in a dynamic and untyped language.
By integrating QuickCheck style test cases as soon as functions are
introduced, it is intended that writing tests and declaring assumptions
become a seamless part of writing software.

##### ○•○

CoffeeScript is available in browsers and environments where
JavaScript is available. The screenshots below show CoffeeScript
running the same web server and client application on Mac OS X,
Windows and iOS.

![figure ../img/TadaOnMacOSX-small.png](../img/TadaOnMacOSX-small.png)\


![figure ../img/TadaOnWin7-small.png](../img/TadaOnWin7-small.png)\


![figure ../img/TadaOnIOS-small.png](../img/TadaOnIOS-small.png)\


The CoffeeScript below shows the brevity of the self-contained
application from the screenshots. It contains an HTML 5 web page
in Coffeekup markup and its own HTTP web server. The page has a
Canvas element with a drawing of the 'Seed of Life'. Coffeekup is
a few hundred lines of CoffeeScript. No frameworks. No JavaScript.
Pure and smooth.

  res.end()

show 'Server running at'
show  server.address()
~~~~

### 开动吧

* * * * * * * * * *


You do not need to install anything to learn CoffeeScript and
complete this book ... as long as you have an up-to-date standard
compliant HTML~5~ web browser.[^2]

If you are new to programming then I recommend that you read through
the book sequentially and solve the exercises along the way. If you
already know JavaScript, then you can choose to read through the
language overview at [coffeescript.org](http://www.coffeescript.org)
and skip forward to solve some of the exercises in the
[Paradigm](#part-iii.-paradigm) chapters.


[^2]:
    The interactive environment requires a web browser with support
    for HTML~5~ technologies. Most current desktop browsers (Safari,
    Firefox, Opera) and Mobile Safari on iOS 5 are fully compatible.
    Offline reading is enabled on capable browsers.

    Chrome 16 and Internet Explorer 9 do not display MathML, but
    there is very little math in the book anyway. Internet Explorer
    9 does not display some of the graphical output (showDocument
    uses a data URL), so choose another browser if possible; older
    versions of Internet Explorer are less functional.

    A test of the Android 2.3 browser on a mobile device did not
    result in a usable interactive environment. An upgrade to a
    newer version was not available.

    Used technologies and API's: EcmaScript 5, canvas with text,
    data URLs, contenteditable, mathml, offline manifest, localstorage,
    CSS hyphenation, getElementsByClassName and UTF-8 unicode. This
    list relates to the interactive environment --- CoffeeScript
    is compatible with a much wider range of browsers and servers
    including Internet Explorer 6. More information on [browser
    capabilities](http://caniuse.com).

    See the [web site](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/)
    if you would like a static HTML or PDF version for an e-reader
    or print. You can also download source files from there.


In this Interactive Edition almost all examples[^3] can be edited
and the changes you make take effect instantly. To open an editor,
touch or click on the program text in the example.

[^3]: Some examples are read-only and can not be executed. A few
are locked to avoid spoiling exercises, some because they are
intended to run on a server, and a few only show a concept without
the surrounding program.

You can choose to disable automatic evaluation in the menu at the
top of this page; then you will have to use a keystroke combination
instead.[^manual] There you can also choose between editing in a plain text
area or with the embedded CodeMirror editor. If you have a compatible
browser then try the CodeMirror option --- it has syntax highlighting
and semi-automatic indentation.

[^manual]: Manual evaluation is only intended for net-books and
mobile devices without sufficient processing power. It is more
inconvenient when you have to remember to evaluate _every_ time you
have typed something. In particular code attached to `Run` buttons
do _not_ change unless the newly entered program text is evaluated.

>**Tip**: Some browsers may become unresponsive when
running for example a never ending loop --- so save work you may
have in other tabs before proceeding.  Should it happen then refresh
this web page or restart your browser.

Some of the examples in the last chapter of the book show WebSockets
--- it is optional but to run them you need a [compatible
browser](../literate/web-socket-status.html) and CoffeeScript on
your system. Installing CoffeeScript on Windows and Mac OS X is
easy, see the couple of steps involved in [Quick CoffeeScript
Install](../literate/install-notes.html).  You get a Read-Eval-Print-Loop
(REPL), a commandline interpreter and compiler that can watch for
file changes and compile your CoffeeScript modules whenever you
save them.

##### ○•○

You will encounter some functions and symbols that are not part of
CoffeeScript when you read through the rest of the book. They are
needed to run the interactive environment and are explained as they
are introduced. The following tables summarize them:

  `showDocument`     embeds an HTML web page inside this web page
  `runOnDemand`      creates a 'Run' button; click it to try the code
  `confirm`          displays a question and 'Yes' and 'No' buttons
  `prompt`           displays a message and an input field
------------------   --------------------------------------------------

* * * * * * * * * *

  Symbol    Explanation
----------- ------------------------------------------------
    `→`     normal output from `show`/`view` functions
    `⇒`     asynchronous  output from display functions
    `↵`     return value from an executed code block
    `☕`     timing information if enabled

## Part II. 语言

* * * * * * * * * *

### 简介

* * * * * * * * * *

个人电脑刚出现的时候，大多数都配备了一种简单的编程语言，一般是BASIC的某种变体。
与电脑的交互跟这种语言关系非常紧密，，所有的电脑用户，不管愿意与否，对这种
语言都略知一二。现在电脑已经非常普遍了，大多数用户只要用鼠标在屏幕上点来点去
就能满足自己的需要。可对于我们这些天生的技术迷来说，离了编程仿佛就是把电脑
关进了笼子里。

拜互联网所赐，现在所有电脑上都装着web浏览器，因此也有Javascript编程环境，
可以很容易地为CoffeeScript所用。本着不用技术细节给用户添堵的精神，这个环境
被藏起来了，但只要有个web页面，就能进入这个环境，并以它为平台学习编程。你正在看
的就是这样一个页面。

本书不光要讲解CoffeeScript，还想介绍编程的基本原则。编程，说实在的，很难。
一般来说，编程的宗旨是保持简单，保持清晰。但在这些基本原则之上构建起来的程序，
会变得越来越复杂，有其固有的规律和复杂性。因此，编程很难呈现出简单或可预测的
状态。该领域的奠基人之一，Donald Knuth 说，这是一门*艺术*。

要想从书里捞到点干货，光看不行。你还得保持清醒的头脑，努力做好书中的练习，有股
不搞明白绝不罢休的劲头。

> *程序员跟宇宙的缔造者一样。程序就是他们创建的虚拟宇宙，
> 可以变得无限复杂.*

Joseph Weizenbaum, *Computer Power and Human Reason*\

计算机程序是个复杂的多面体。它是程序员敲的一段文本，是指挥电脑工作的直接命令，是存在
内存里的数据，还控制着其所在内存的动作。在我们熟知的东西里很难找到跟程序类似的
东西，不过勉强可以把它比作一台机器。机械表的齿轮巧妙地契合在一起，如果表匠好，这块
表能精确地走好多年。程序的各个元素也是这样组合在一起，如果程序员知道自己在干啥，程序
也能平稳运行。

电脑就是运行这些非物质机器的宿主。电脑本身只能傻乎乎地做一些简单的动作，但它们做这些
事情的速度快得让人眼花缭乱的。程序能把很多简单的动作组合起来，完成非常复杂的任务。

编程是个让人着迷的游戏。一个程序就是一座思想之塔。搭建它不用花一文钱，也没重量，敲敲
键盘它就能长。如果我们忘乎所以，程序的规模和复杂度很快就会失去控制，连创建者都会被搞
糊涂。这就是编程最主要的问题。所以现如今很多软件都会崩溃，出错，搞砸了。

能正常运转的程序很美。编程的艺术就是控制复杂度的技巧。优秀的程序是被驯服的猛兽，
能在复杂中呈现简单。


##### ○•○

现在，很多程序员认为只在程序中使用一小部分大家所熟知的技术可以控制这种复杂性。他们给
正规的程序设定了严格的规则，而其中的狂热分子会声讨那些胆敢打破这些规则的“坏”程序员。

要把编程变成简单直接和可预测的东西，要给所有奇美的程序加上各种限制。这对丰富多彩的
编程是有多大敌意啊！编程技术的迷人之处就在于其广袤的多样性，有很多尚未探索过的蛮荒之地。

其中肯定有各种陷阱和圈套，引诱着经验不足的程序员犯下各种恐怖的错误，但因此而固步自封，
因噎废食的程序员肯定会忘掉自己的乐趣，失去编程的乐趣（只好变成经理）。正确的做法是在
编程时小心谨慎，充分发挥你的聪明才智。随着不断的学习，你总会遇到新的挑战，进入新的领域。



衡量程序的终极标准是它做的对不对。效率，清晰度，大小虽然也都重要，但如何平衡他们， 
每个程序员必须自己做出判断。经验法则固然有用，但违反它们也未尝不可。

最初，计算机刚刚诞生时，根本没有编程语言。程序是下面这种东西：


~~~~ {.listing}

这段程序从1加到10，并输出结果(1 + 2 + … + 10 = 55)。它可以在非常简单的计算机
上运行。要给早期计算机编程，必须把一大组开关拨到正确的位置上，或者在硬纸带上打孔，
输入到计算机里。你可以想象得出来，这个过程是多么的繁琐和容易出错。即便写个简单
的程序，也需要极大的聪明才智和严明的纪律，复杂的就别想了，没戏。

当然，手工输入这些晦涩的位模式（上面这种1和0一般都这么叫）的确给程序员一种自己是
神奇魔法师的良好感觉。从工作的满意度来讲，的确是值得的。

程序的每一行都有一条指令，翻成汉语就是：

~~~~ {.listing}
1 把数值 0 存在内存的位置 0 中
2 把数值 1 存在内存的位置 1 中
3 把内存位置 1 中的值存在位置 2 中
4 将位置 2 中的值减去 11 
5 如果内存位置 2 中的值是 0，转而执行指令 9
6 将内存位置 1 的值加到 位置 0 上
7 给内存位置 1 的值加 1
8 转而执行指令 3
9 输出内存位置 0 中的值
~~~~

尽管这比那段二进制代码的可读性更强，但还是不太好。用名字代替指令和内存位置的数值
可能会更好：

~~~~ {.listing}
Set 'total' to 0
Set 'count' to 1
[loop]
Set 'compare' to 'count'
Subtract 11 from 'compare'
If 'compare' is zero, continue at [end]
Add 'count' to 'total'
Add 1 to 'count'
Continue at [loop]
[end]
Output 'total'
~~~~

这就不难看出来这程序是怎么回事儿了。头两行给两个内存位置设置了初始值：`total`
用来保存程序的运行结果，`count`用来跟踪我们目前要加的数值。用`compare`那一行
应该是最奇怪的。它的作用是程序用来判断`count`是否等于11，以便决定是否应该停下
来。因为机器太原始，所以它只能判断数值是否为0，然后根据判断结果决定（跳转）。
所以它用标签为`compare` 的内存位置计算 `count - 11`的值，并以此值为依据做
出决定。接下来的两行将`count`的值加到结果上，只要还不是11，就给`count`加1。
下面是同一程序的CoffeeScript实现：


~~~~ {.coffeescript}
total = 0
count = 1
while count <= 10
  total += count
  count += 1
total
~~~~

这段代码又有几处改善。其中最重要的是我们再不用关心程序如何向前后跳转。魔咒
`while`会帮我们处理好这些事情。只要满足条件： `count <= 10`，即`count`小于
等于10，它就继续执行。很明显，已经没必要创建一个临时值并判断它是否等于0了。这是
一个无脑的小细节，而变成语言的力量就在于它能帮我们处理那些无脑的小细节。

在CoffeeScript中，还可以用更短的代码表示相同的意思：

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
total = 0
total += count for count in [1..10]
total
~~~~

关键字 `for` 和 `in` 遍历 1 到 10 之间的数值 `[1..10]`，依次将其中的值赋给
`count`。然后将其加到`total`上。

最后，如果恰好有个便捷的`sum`操作，能像数学符号 $\sum_{n=1}^{10}n$ 那样计算
一个集合数值的和值，代码还可以更简洁：


~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
sum [1..10]
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Summation using a reduce function
sum = (v) -> _.reduce v, ((a,b) -> a+b), 0
sum [1..10]
~~~~

#####

还有一种可能，这个数据类型恰好有个函数。数组上有个sum函数，可以给出数组
元素的和值。


~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
[1..10].sum()
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Summation using reduce attached to Array
Array::sum = -> @reduce ((a,b) -> a+b), 0
show [1..10].sum()
delete Array::sum
~~~~

#####

之所以讲这个故事，是想告诉你，同样的程序，其表示方式可长可断，可以让你看懂，
也可以让你看不懂。我们这个程序的第一版非常难懂，而最后一个几乎就是普通英文：
`show` 从 `1` 到 `10` 这写数值的 `sum` （在后续章节中，你会看到如何构建
`sum`这样的东西）。


好的编程语言能让程序员以更简明的方式表示自己的想法。可以把无聊的细节隐藏起来，
提供便捷的构件（比如 `while`结构），而且一般还能让程序员添加自己的构件（比如
 `sum`操作）。

JavaScript is the language that is, at the moment, mostly being
used to do all kinds of clever and horrible things with pages on
the World Wide Web. JavaScript is also used for scripting in [a
variety of applications and operating
systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Uses_outside_web_pages).
Of special note is server-side JavaScript (SSJS), where the server
portion of a web application is written in JavaScript, so a full
application can be expressed in one programming language. CoffeeScript
generates standard JavaScript code and can therefore be used in
environments where standard JavaScript is accepted. It means that
both browser portions and server portions can be written in
CoffeeScript.

CoffeeScript is a new language so it remains to be seen how popular
it becomes for general application development, but if you are
interested in programming, CoffeeScript is definitely a useful
language to learn.  Even if you do not end up doing much web
programming, the mind-bending programs in this book will always
stay with you, haunt you, and influence the programs you write in
other languages.

There are those who will say *terrible* things about JavaScript.
Many of these things are true. When I was for the first time required
to write something in JavaScript, I quickly came to despise the
language. It would accept almost anything I typed, but interpret
it in a way that was completely different from what I meant. This
had a lot to do with the fact that I did not have a clue what I was
doing, but there is also a real issue here: JavaScript is ridiculously
liberal in what it allows.  The idea behind this design was that
it would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In
actuality, it mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder,
because the system will not point them out to you.

However, the flexibility of the language is also an advantage. It
leaves space for a lot of techniques that are impossible in more
rigid languages, and it can be used to overcome some of JavaScript's
shortcomings. After learning it properly, and working with it for
a while, I have really learned to *like* this language. CoffeeScript
repairs many of the confusing and cumbersome aspects of JavaScript,
while keeping its underlying flexibility and beauty. It is
*doubleplusgood*.

##### ○•○

Most chapters in this book contain quite a lot of code[^C].  In my
experience, reading and writing code is an important part of learning
to program. Try to not just glance over these examples, but read
them attentively and understand them. This can be slow and confusing
at first, but you will quickly get the hang of it. The same goes
for the exercises. Do not assume you understand them until you have
actually written a working solution.

[^C]:  'Code' is the substance that programs are made of. Every
piece of a program, whether it is a single line or the whole thing,
can be referred to as 'code'.


Because of the way the web works, it is always possible to look at
the JavaScript programs that people put in their web-pages. This
can be a good way to learn how some things are done. Because most
web programmers are not 'professional' programmers, or consider
JavaScript programming so uninteresting that they never properly
learned it, a lot of the code you can find like this is of a *very*
bad quality. When learning from ugly or incorrect code, the ugliness
and confusion will propagate into your own code, so be careful who
you learn from. Another source of programs are CoffeeScript projects
hosted on open source services such as [github](https://github.com).


* * * * * * * * * *

### Basic CoffeeScript:\
 values, variables, and control flow

* * * * * * * * * *


Inside the computer's world, there is only data. That which is not
data, does not exist. Although all data is in essence just a sequence
of bits[^D], and is thus fundamentally alike, every piece of data
plays its own role. In CoffeeScript's system, most of this data is
neatly separated into things called value[](#index-value)s. Every
value has a type, which determines the kind of role it can play.
There are six basic types of values: Numbers, strings, booleans,
objects, functions, and undefined values.

[^D]:  Bits are any kinds of two-valued things, usually described
as `0`s and `1`s. Inside the computer, they take forms like a high
or low electrical charge, a strong or weak signal, a shiny or dull
spot on the surface of a CD.

To create a value, one must merely invoke its name. This is very
convenient. You do not have to gather building material for your
values, or pay for them, you just call for one and *woosh*, you
have it. They are not created from thin air, of course. Every value
has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic amount
of them at the same time you might run out of computer memory.
Fortunately, this is only a problem if you need them all simultaneously.
As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving
behind only a few bits. These bits are recycled to make the next
generation of values.

##### ○•○

Values of the type number[](#index-number) are, as you might have
deduced, numeric values. They are written the way numbers are usually
written:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
144
~~~~

Enter that in the console, and the same thing is printed in the
output window. The text you typed in gave rise to a number value,
and the console took this number and wrote it out to the screen
again. In a case like this, that was a rather pointless exercise,
but soon we will be producing values in less straightforward ways,
and it can be useful to 'try them out' on the console to see what
they produce.

This is what `144` looks like in bits[^E]:

~~~~ {.listing}
01000000 01100010 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
~~~~

The number above has 64 bits. Numbers in CoffeeScript always do.
This has one important repercussion: There is a limited amount of
different numbers that can be expressed. With three decimal digits,
only the numbers 0 to 999 can be written, which is 10^3^ = 1000
different numbers. With 64 binary digits, 2^64^ different numbers
can be written.  This is a lot, more than 10^19^ (a one with nineteen
zeros).

[^E]:  If you were expecting something like `10010000` here — good
call, but read on. CoffeeScript's numbers are not stored as integers.

Not all whole numbers below 10^19^ fit in a CoffeeScript number
though.  For one, there are also negative numbers, so one of the
bits has to be used to store the sign of the number. A bigger issue
is that non-whole numbers must also be represented. To do this, 11
bits are used to store the position of the decimal dot within the
number.

That leaves 52 bits[^F]. Any whole number less than 2^52^, which
is over 10^15^, will safely fit in a CoffeeScript number. In most
cases, the numbers we are using stay well below that, so we do not
have to concern ourselves with bits at all. Which is good. I have
nothing in particular against bits, but you *do* need a terrible
lot of them to get anything done. When at all possible, it is more
pleasant to deal with bigger things.

[^F]:  Actually, 53, because of a trick that can be used to get one
bit for free. Look up the 'IEEE 754' format if you are curious about
the details.

Fractional numbers are written by using a dot.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
9.81
~~~~

For very big or very small numbers, one can also use 'scientific'
notation by adding an `e`, followed by the exponent of the number:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
2.998e8
~~~~

Which is 2.998 ⋅ 10^8^ = 299 800 000.

Calculations with whole numbers (also called integers) that fit in
52 bits are guaranteed to always be precise. Unfortunately,
calculations with fractional numbers are generally not. Like *π*
(pi) can not be precisely expressed by a finite amount of decimal
digits, many numbers lose some precision when only 64 bits are
available to store them. This is a shame, but it only causes practical
problems in very specific situations[^G]. The important thing is
to be aware of it, and treat fractional digital numbers as
approximations, not as precise values.

[^G]:  An example of this, if `p = 1/3` then `6*p` is equal to `2`.
However `p+p+p+p+p+p` is not equal to `2` because the minute rounding
errors increase for every addition. This happens in the `for` loop
shown in the [Foreword example, Seed of Life↑](#foreword). It is a
general issue with floating point approximations and not a bug in
CoffeeScript.  A way of dealing with it is to test if a number is
inside a narrow interval instead of testing for an exact match.

##### ○•○

The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. Arithmetic operations
such as addition or multiplication take two number values and produce
a new number from them. Here is what they look like in CoffeeScript:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
100 + 4 * 11
~~~~

The `+` and `*` symbols are called operators. The first stands for
addition, and the second for multiplication. Putting an operator
between two values will apply[](#index-applying) it to those values,
and produce a new value.

Does the example mean 'add 4 and 100, and multiply the result by
11', or is the multiplication done before the adding? As you might
have guessed, the multiplication happens first. But, as in mathematics,
this can be changed by wrapping the addition in parentheses[](#index-()):

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
(100 + 4) * 11
~~~~

For subtraction, there is the `-` operator, and division can be
done with `/`. When operators appear together without parentheses,
the order in which they are applied is determined by the
precedence[](#index-precedence) of the operators. The first example
shows that multiplication has a higher precedence than addition.
Division and multiplication always come before subtraction and
addition. When multiple operators with the same precedence appear
next to each other (`1 - 1 + 1`) they are applied left-to-right.

Try to figure out what value this produces, and then copy it to the
next field to see if you were correct…

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
115 * 4 - 4 + 88 / 2
~~~~

> Touch or click in the following field to write in it. To evaluate
some CoffeeScript, either just type it in Auto Evaluation mode or
press ↑ / ↩ (Shift/Enter) while in the field in manual mode.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

These rules of precedence are not something you should worry about.
When in doubt, just add parentheses.

There is one more arithmetic operator which is probably less familiar
to you. The `%` symbol is used to represent the modulo[](#index-modulo)
operation.  `X` modulo `Y` is the remainder of dividing `X` by `Y`.
For example `314 % 100` is `14`, `10 % 3` is `1`, and `144 % 12`
is `0`. Modulo has the same precedence as multiplication and division.

##### ○•○

The next data type is the string[](#index-string). Its use is not
as evident from its name as with numbers, but it also fulfills a
very basic role. Strings are used to represent text, the name
supposedly derives from the fact that it strings together a bunch
of characters. Strings are written by enclosing their content in
quotes:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'Patch my boat with chewing gum.'
~~~~

Almost anything can be put between quotes, and CoffeeScript will
make a string value out of it. But a few characters are tricky. You
can imagine how putting quotes between quotes might be hard.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}

CoffeeScript implements both single quoted and double quoted strings,
which can be handy when you have only one kind of quote in a string.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
"Aha! It's 43 if I'm not a bit off"
~~~~

Double quoted strings can contain interpolated values, small snippets
of CoffeeScript code between `#{` and `}`. The code is evaluated
and inserted into the string.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
"2 + 2 gives #{2 + 2}"
~~~~

Newlines, the things you get when you press enter, can not be put
between quotes in the normal form of strings. A string can span
multiple lines to help avoid overly long lines in the program but
the line breaks are not shown in the output.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'Imagine if this was a
 very long line of text'
~~~~

##### ○•○

CoffeeScript has triple-quoted strings aka heredocs[](#index-heredocs)
to make it easy to have strings that span multiple lines where the line
breaks are preserved in the output. Indentation before the quotes are
ignored so the following lines can be aligned nicely.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'''First comes A
   then comes B'''
~~~~

The triple double quoted variant allows for interpolated values.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
"""Math 101:
     1
   + 1
   ---
     #{1 + 1}"""
~~~~

Still to be able to have special characters in a string, the following
trick is used: Whenever a backslash ('`\`') is found inside quoted
text, it indicates that the character after it has a special meaning.
A quote that is preceded by a backslash will not end the string,
but be part of it. When an '`n`' character occurs after a backslash,
it is interpreted as a newline[](#index-newline). Similarly, a
'`t`' after a backslash means a tab character.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'This is the first line\nAnd this is the second'
~~~~

There are of course situations where you want a backslash in a
string to be just a backslash, not a special code. If two backslashes
follow each other, they will collapse right into each other, and
only one will be left in the resulting string value:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'A newline character is written like "\\n".'
~~~~

##### ○•○

Strings can not be divided, multiplied, or subtracted. The `+`
operator *can* be used on them. It does not add, but it concatenates,
it glues two strings together.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'con' + 'cat' + 'e' + 'nate'
~~~~

There are more ways of manipulating strings, but these are discussed
later.

##### ○•○

Not all operators are symbols, some are written as words. For
example, the `typeof` operator, which produces a string value naming
the type of the value you give it.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
typeof 4.5
~~~~

The other operators we saw all operated on two values, `typeof`
takes only one. Operators that use two values are called binary
operators[](#index-binary-operator), while those that take one are
called unary operators[](#index-unary-operator). The minus[](#index--)
operator can be used both as a binary and unary operator[^H]:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
-(10 - 2)
~~~~

[^H]: Note that there is no space between the unary minus and the value.

##### ○•○

Then there are values of the boolean[](#index-boolean) type. There
are two of these: `true` and `false`. CoffeeScript has some aliases
for them: `true` can be written as `yes` or `on`.  `false` as `no`
or `off`. These alternatives can in some cases make a program easier
to read.  Here is one way to produce a `true` value:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
3 > 2
~~~~

And `false` can be produced like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
3 < 2
~~~~

I hope you have seen the `>` and `<` signs before. They mean,
respectively, 'is greater than' and 'is less than'. They are binary
operators, and the result of applying them is a boolean value that
indicates whether they hold in this case. You can chain
comparisons[](#index-chained-comparison) to test if something is
within an interval. These comparisons give respectively `true` and
`false`:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
100 < 115 < 200
~~~~

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
100 < 315 < 200
~~~~

Strings can be compared in the same way:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'Aardvark' < 'Zoroaster'
~~~~

The way strings are ordered is more or less alphabetic. More or
less… Uppercase letters are always 'less' than lowercase ones, so
`'Z' < 'a'` is `true`, and non-alphabetic characters (' `!`', '`@`',
etc) are also included in the ordering. The actual way in which the
comparison is done is based on the Unicode[](#index-Unicode)
standard.  This standard assigns a number to virtually every character
one would ever need, including characters from Greek, Arabic,
Japanese, Tamil, and so on. Having such numbers is practical for
storing strings inside a computer — you can represent them as a
list of numbers. When comparing strings, CoffeeScript just compares
the numbers of the characters inside the string, from left to right.

Other similar operators are `>=` ('is greater than or equal to'),
`<=` ('is less than or equal to'), `==` ('is equal to'), and `!=`
('is not equal to'). Equal to can also be written in text as `is`
and not equal to as `isnt`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'Itchy' isnt 'Scratchy'
~~~~

##### ○•○

There are also some useful operations that can be applied to boolean
values themselves. CoffeeScript supports three logical operators:
`and`, `or`, and `not`. These can be used to 'reason' about booleans.

The logical `and` operator can also be written as `&&`. It is a
binary operator, and its result is only `true` if both of the values
given to it are `true`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
true and false
~~~~

Logical `or` with alias `||`, is `true` if either of the values
given to it is `true`:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
true or false
~~~~

`not` can be written as an exclamation mark, `!`, it is a unary
operator that flips the value given to it, `!true` is `false`, and
`not false` is `true`.

#### *Exercise 1*

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
((4 >= 6) || ('grass' != 'green')) and !(((12 * 2) == 144) and true)
~~~~

Is this true? For readability, there are a lot of unnecessary
parentheses in there. This simple version means the same thing:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
(4 >= 6 or 'grass' isnt 'green') and not(12 * 2 is 144 and true)
~~~~

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

Yes, it is `true`. You can reduce it step by step like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
(false or true) and not (false and true)
true and not false
true
~~~~

I hope you noticed that `'grass'  != 'green'` is `true`. Grass may
be green, but it is not equal to green.

####

It is not always obvious when parentheses are needed. In practice,
one can usually get by with knowing that of the operators we have
seen so far, `or` has the lowest precedence, then comes `and`, then
the comparison operators ( `>`, `==`, etcetera), and then the rest.
This has been chosen in such a way that, in simple cases, as few
parentheses as possible are necessary.

##### ○•○

All the examples so far have used the language like you would use
a pocket calculator. Make some values and apply operators to them
to get new values. Creating values like this is an essential part
of every CoffeeScript program, but it is only a part. A piece of
code that produces a value is called an expression[](#index-expression).
Every value that is written directly (such as `22` or `'psychoanalysis'`)
is an expression. An expression between parentheses is also an
expression. And a binary operator applied to two expressions, or a
unary operator applied to one, is also an expression.

There are a few more ways of building expressions, which will be
revealed when the time is ripe.

There exists a unit that is bigger than an expression. It is called
a statement[](#index-statement). A program is built as a list of
statements. Most statements end with a newline, although a statement
can stretch over many lines. Statements can also end with a
semicolon[](#index-semicolon) (`;`). In CoffeeScript semicolon is
mostly used if you want to place multiple statements on the same
line. The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon
after it. This is a program:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
1; not false
~~~~

It is a useless program. An expression can be content to just produce
a value, but a statement only amounts to something if it somehow
changes the world. It could print something to the screen — that
counts as changing the world — or it could change the internal state
of the program in a way that will affect the statements that come
after it.  These changes are called 'side effects[](#index-side-effect)'.
The statements in the example above just produce the values `1` and
`true`, and then immediately throw them into the bit bucket[^I].
This leaves no impression on the world at all, and is not a side
effect.

[^I]: The bit bucket is supposedly the place where old bits are kept.
On some systems, the programmer has to manually empty it now and
then.  Fortunately, CoffeeScript comes with a fully-automatic
bit-recycling system.

##### ○•○

How does a program keep an internal state? How does it remember
things?  We have seen how to produce new values from old values,
but this does not change the old values, and the new value has to
be immediately used or it will dissipate again. To catch and hold
values, CoffeeScript provides a thing called a
variable[](#index-variable).

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
caught = 5 * 5
~~~~

A variable always has a name, and it can point at a value, holding
on to it. The statement above creates a variable called `caught`
and uses it to grab hold of the number that is produced by multiplying
`5` by `5`.

After running the above program, you can type the word `caught`
into the console, and it will retrieve the value `25` for you. The
name of a variable is used to fetch its value.  `caught + 1` also
works. A variable name can be used as an expression, and thus can
be part of bigger expressions.

Assigning a value to a new variable name with the `=` operator,
creates the new variable. Variable names can be almost every word,
but they may not include spaces. Digits can be part of variable
names, `catch22` is a valid name, but the name must not start with
one. The characters '`$`' and '`_`' can be used in names as if they
were letters, so `$_$` is a correct variable name.

When a variable points at a value, that does not mean it is tied
to that value forever. At any time, the `=` operator can be used
on existing variables to yank them away from their current value
and make them point to a new one.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
caught = 4 * 4
~~~~

##### ○•○

You should imagine variables as tentacles, rather than boxes. They
do not *contain* values, they *grasp* them — two variables can refer
to the same value. Only the values that the program still has a
hold on can be accessed by it. When you need to remember something,
you grow a tentacle to hold on to it, or re-attach one of your
existing tentacles to a new value:

> To remember the amount of dollars that Luigi still owes you, you
could use a variable… Then, every time Luigi pays something back,
this amount can be decremented by giving the variable a new number:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
luigiDebt = 140
luigiDebt = luigiDebt - 35
~~~~

The collection of variables and their values that exist at a given
time is called the environment[](#index-environment). When a program
starts up, this environment is not empty. It always contains a
number of standard variables.

If you install CoffeeScript and use the `coffee` command line program
to execute a CoffeeScript program or run the interactive environment
with `coffee -r ./prelude` then the environment is called `global`.
You can view it by typing: →∣ / 'Tab'. When your browser loads a
page, it creates a new environment called `window` and attaches
these standard values to it. The variables created and modified by
programs on that page survive until the browser goes to a new
page.[^4]

[^4]: In the interactive environment the rules are slightly different.
Variables can only be used outside the code block where they are
defined if they are named in the `@globalNames` list (defined in
[Getting Started](#getting-started)) or if they are attached explicitly
to the global environment i.e. starts with an `@`-sign or is a
`window` property.  This prevents unintended use of variables from
earlier chapters and gives a bit of protection from accidental
overwrites of system variables.

##### ○•○

A lot of the values provided by the standard environment have the
type 'function'[](#index-function). A function is a piece of program
wrapped in a value. Generally, this piece of program does something
useful, which can be evoked using the function value that contains
it. In the development environment, the variable `show` [](#index-show)
holds a function that shows a message in the terminal or command
line window. You can use it like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show 'Also, your hair is on fire.'
~~~~

[](#index-())Executing the code in a function is called
invoking[](#index-invoking) or applying[](#index-applying) it.
The notation for doing this is the function name followed by
parentheses or a comma separated list of values. Every expression
that produces a function value can be invoked by putting parentheses
after it. The parentheses can be left out when values are passed.
The string value is given to the function, which uses it as the
text to show in the console window. Values given to functions are
called parameters[](#index-parameter) or arguments[](#index-argument).
`show` needs only one of them, but other functions might need a
different number.

##### ○•○

Showing a message is a side effect. A lot of functions are useful
because of the side effects they produce. It is also possible for
a function to produce a value, in which case it does not need to
have a side effect to be useful. For example, there is a function
`Math.max`[](#index-Math.max), which takes two arguments and gives
back the biggest of the two:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show Math.max 2, 4
~~~~

[](#index-Math.max)When a function produces a value, it is said
to return[](#index-return) it. Because things that produce values
are always expressions in CoffeeScript, function calls can be used
as a part of bigger expressions:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show 100 + Math.max 7, 4
show Math.max(7, 4) + 100
show Math.max(7, 4 + 100)
show Math.max 7, 4 + 100
~~~~

When parentheses are left out from a function call then CoffeeScript
implicitly inserts them stretching to the end of the line. In the
example above it means that the first two lines gives the answer
`107` and the last two `104`. So depending on your intention you
may have to use parentheses to get the result you want.
[Functions↓](#functions) discusses writing your own functions.

##### ○•○

As the previous examples illustrated, `show` can be useful for
showing the result of an expression.  `show` is not a standard
CoffeeScript function, browsers do not provide it for you, it is
made available by the interactive environment. When you create your
own programs in the web browser, you can instead use `alert` to pop
up a dialog with a message or `console.log` to direct output to
your browsers built-in console.

We will continue in the CoffeeScript environment. `show`[](#index-show)
tries to display its argument the way it would look in a program,
which can give more information about the type of a value. In an
interactive console, started with `coffee -r ./prelude`, you can
explore the environment or you can try it right here:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show Math.PI
show console if console?
show showDocument
~~~~

What the output means is not so important for now. `show` is a tool
that can give you details on the things in your programs, which can
be handy later, if something does not behave the way you had expected.
A variant of `show` is `view` it returns the value it displays.
That can be helpful when you want to see what is going on inside a
long expression.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + view 6 + 7
~~~~

##### ○•○

The environment provided by browsers contains a few more functions
for popping up windows. You can ask the user an OK/Cancel question
using `confirm`[](#index-confirm). This returns a boolean, `true`
if the user presses 'OK', and `false` if he presses 'Cancel'. The
interactive environment has a similar `confirm` function where the
user is asked yes or no to a question. It displays the question and
its buttons inline in the output.

Blocking a user interface with a question should only happen when
getting an answer _right_ now is _really_ critical. None of the
questions on this page are, you can continue reading without answering
any of them. In a CoffeeScript server, a question should normally
not stop the process and wait for a user to reply.  Instead the
program continues running the code following the function call.
Eventually when the user has answered the question, then a function
given as an argument is called with the answer. This piece of code
involves a bit of magic, that will be explained in
[Functions↓](#functions). While it is more complicated for this
use, we will in later chapters see that it makes perfect sense for
web applications with many users and in responsive user interfaces.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
confirm 'Shall we, then?', (answer) -> show answer
~~~~

#### Prompt

`prompt`[](#index-prompt) can be used to ask an 'open' question.
The first argument is the question, the second one is the text that
the user starts with. A line of text can be typed into the window,
and the function will — in a browsers' default implementation —
return this as a string. As with `confirm` the interactive environment
offers a similar function, that takes a third argument which will
receive the answer.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
prompt 'Tell us everything you know', '...',
  (answer) -> show 'So you know: ' + answer
~~~~

##### ○•○

It is possible to give almost every variable in the environment a
new value. This can be useful, but also dangerous. If you give
`show` the value `8`, you will not be able to show things anymore.
You can refresh this web page to start over. If your browser supports
offline web apps then you can even refresh this web page when you
are somewhere without internet - this works for example on iOS 5.
Some functions like `confirm` and `prompt` also work when you run
your program from a file, but they interact poorly with the server
environment. So should you try these examples there, then fortunately...
you can stop a server program with `CTRL-C` and pick up where you
left off.

##### ○•○

One-line programs are not very interesting. When you put more than one
statement into a program, the statements are, predictably, executed one
at a time, from top to bottom.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
prompt 'Pick a number', '', (answer) ->
  theNumber = Number answer
  show 'Your number is the square root of ' +
    (theNumber * theNumber)
~~~~

The function `Number`[](#index-Number) converts a value to a number,
which is needed in this case because the answer from `prompt` is a
string value. There are similar functions called `String`[](#index-String)
and `Boolean`[](#index-Boolean) which convert values to those
types.

##### ○•○

Consider a program that prints out all even numbers from 0 to 12.
One way to write this is:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show 0
show 2
show 4
show 6
show 8
show 10
show 12
~~~~

That works, but the idea of writing a program is to make something
*less* work, not more. If we needed all even numbers below 1000,
the above would be unworkable. What we need is a way to automatically
repeat some code.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
currentNumber = 0
while currentNumber <= 12
  show currentNumber
  currentNumber = currentNumber + 2
~~~~

You may have seen `while`[](#index-while) in the
[Introduction↑](#introduction) chapter. A statement starting
with the word `while` creates a loop[](#index-loop). A loop is a
disturbance in the sequence of statements, it may cause the program
to repeat some statements multiple times. In this case, the word
`while` is followed by an expression, which is used to determine
whether the loop will loop or finish. As long as the boolean value
produced by this expression is `true`, the code in the loop is
repeated. As soon as it is false, the program goes to the bottom
of the loop and continues as normal.

The variable `currentNumber` demonstrates the way a variable can
track the progress of a program.  Every time the loop repeats, it
is incremented by `2`, and at the beginning of every repetition,
it is compared with the number `12` to decide whether to keep on
looping.

The third part of a `while` statement is another statement. This
is the body[](#index-body) of the loop, the action or actions that
must take place multiple times.  Indentation[](#index-indentation)
is used to group statements into blocks[](#index-block). To the
world outside the block, a block counts as a single statement. In
the example, this is used to include in the loop both the call to
`show` and the statement that updates `currentNumber`.

If we did not have to print the numbers, the program could have
been:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
counter = 0

while counter <= 12 then counter = counter + 2
~~~~

Here, `counter = counter + 2` is the statement that forms the body
of the loop. The `then` keyword separates the boolean from the body,
so both can be on the same line.

#### *Exercise 2*

Use the techniques shown so far to write a program that calculates
and shows the value of 2^10^ (2 to the 10th power). You are,
obviously, not allowed to use a cheap trick like just writing
`2 * 2 * ...`

If you are having trouble with this, try to see it in terms of the
even-numbers example. The program must perform an action a certain
amount of times. A counter variable with a `while` loop can be used
for that. Instead of printing the counter, the program must multiply
something by 2. This something should be another variable, in which
the result value is built up.

Do not worry if you do not quite see how this would work yet. Even
if you perfectly understand all the techniques this chapter covers,
it can be hard to apply them to a specific problem. Reading and
writing code will help develop a feeling for this, so study the
solution, and try the next exercise.

The counter could also start at `1` and check for `<= 10`, but, for
reasons that will become apparent later on, it is a good idea to
get used to counting from 0.

Obviously, your own solutions are not required to be precisely the
same as mine. They should work. And if they are very different,
make sure you also understand my solution.

> <code class="sourceCode"><span class="er">NOTE</span></code>
When solving the exercises beware of never ending loops (loops where
the condition does not change). A problem loop can look like this:
`while counter then counter`. Since the `counter` is not changed
the loop will go on forever. If one is present then your browser
will become unresponsive and you will have to reload the page or
restart the browser.

> Such a loop can occur accidentally while entering a solution.
To make the problem less likely, write your code after the line
`runOnDemand ->`. Start each line with two spaces (or more). When
your solution is ready, press the `Run` button.


#### *Exercise 3*

With some slight modifications, the solution to the previous exercise
can be made to draw a triangle. And when I say 'draw a triangle' I
mean 'print out some text that almost looks like a triangle when
you squint'.

Print out ten lines. On the first line there is one '\#' character.
On the second there are two. And so on.

How does one get a string with X '\#' characters in it? One way is
to build it every time it is needed with an 'inner loop' — a loop
inside a loop. A simpler way is to reuse the string that the previous
iteration of the loop used, and add one character to it.

You will have noticed the spaces I put in front of some statements.
These are required: The level of indentation decides which block a
line belongs to. The role of the indentation[](#index-indentation)
inside blocks is to make the structure of the code clearer to a
reader. Because new blocks can be opened inside other blocks, it
can become hard to see where one block ends and another begins if
they were not indented. When lines are indented, the visual shape
of a program corresponds to the shape of the blocks inside it. I
like to use two spaces for every open block, but tastes differ. If
a line becomes too long, then you can split it between two words
or place a `\` at the end of the line and continue on the next.

##### ○•○

The uses of `while` we have seen so far all show the same pattern.
First, a 'counter' variable is created. This variable tracks the
progress of the loop. The `while` itself contains a check, usually
to see whether the counter has reached some boundary yet. Then, at
the end of the loop body, the counter is updated.

A lot of loops fall into this pattern. For this reason, CoffeeScript,
and similar languages, also provide a slightly shorter and more
comprehensive form:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for number in [0..12] by 2 then show number
~~~~

This program is exactly equivalent to the earlier even-number-printing
example. The only change is that all the statements that are related
to the 'state' of the loop are now on one line. The numbers in
square brackets are a range[](#index-range) `[4..7]`, a list of
numbers starting from the first number and going up one by one to
the last. A range with two dots includes the last number in the
list `(4,5,6,7)`, with three dots `[4...7]` the last number is
excluded `(4,5,6)`. The amount of each step can be changed with the
`by` keyword. So `[2..6] by 2` gives the list `(2,4,6)`. Ranges can
also decrement if the first number is largest, or involve negative
numbers or floating point numbers.

The `number` in the `for`[](#index-for) comprehension take on each
successive value from the range during each turn through the loop.
The `number` value is then available in the loop body where it can
be used in computations or as here in `show number`. In most cases
this is shorter and clearer than a `while` construction.

The `for` comprehension can take on other forms as well.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# For with indented body
for number in [0..12] by 2
  show number
~~~~

Another is that the body of the loop can be given before the `for`
statement.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# For with prepended body
show number for number in [0..12] by 2
~~~~

The lines that starts with '#' in the previous example might have
looked a bit suspicious to you. It is often useful to include extra
text in a program. The most common use for this is adding some
explanations in human language to a program.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# The variable counter, which is about to be defined,
# is going to start with a value of 0, which is zero.
counter = 0
# Now, we are going to loop, hold on to your hat.
while  counter < 100 # counter is less than one hundred
  ###
  Every time we loop, we INCREMENT the value of counter
  Seriously, we just add one to it.
  ###
  counter++
# And then, we are done.

This kind of text is called a comment[](#index-comment). The rules
are like this: '`#`' starts a comment, which goes on until the end
of the line. '`###`' starts another kind of comment that goes on
until a '`###`' is found so it can stretch over multiple lines.

As you can see, even the simplest programs can be made to look big,
ugly, and complicated by simply adding a lot of comments to them.

I have been using some rather odd capitalisation[](#index-capitalisation)
in some variable names. Because you can not have spaces in these
names — the computer would read them as two separate variables —
your choices for a name that is made of several words are more or
less limited to the following:

~~~~ {.listing}
  fuzzylittleturtle                 FuzzyLittleTurtle
  fuzzy_little_turtle               fuzzyLittleTurtle
~~~~

The first one is hard to read. Personally, I like the one with the
underscores, though it is a little painful to type. However, since
CoffeeScript evolved from JavaScript, most CoffeeScript programmers
follow the JavaScript convention with the last one. Its the one
used by the standard JavaScript functions. It is not hard to get
used to little things like that, so I will just follow the crowd
and capitalise the first letter of every word after the first.

In a few cases, such as the `Number` function, the first letter of
a variable is also capitalised. This was done to mark this function
as a constructor. What a constructor is will become clear in [Object
Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming). For now, the important
thing is not to be bothered by this apparent lack of consistency.

##### ○•○

Note that names that have a special meaning, such as `while`, and
`for` may not be used as variable names. These are called
keywords[](#index-keyword). There are also a number of
[](#index-reserved-words)words which are 'reserved for use' in
future versions of JavaScript and CoffeeScript. These are also
officially not allowed to be used as variable names, though some
environments do allow them. The full list in [Reserved
Words↓](#reserved-words) is rather long.

Do not worry about memorising these for now, but remember that this
might be the problem when something does not work as expected. In
my experience, `char` (to store a one-character string) and
`class`[](#index-class) are the most common names to accidentally
use.

#### *Exercise 4*

instead of `while`.

[](#index-+=)[](#index--=)[](#index-/=)[](#index-*=)A program
often needs to 'update' a variable with a value that is based on
its previous value. For example `counter = counter + 1`. CoffeeScript
provides a shortcut for this: `counter += 1`. This also works for
many other operators, for example `result *= 2` to double the value
of `result`, or `counter -= 1` to count downwards.  `counter++` and
`counter--`[](#index-++)[](#index--) are shorter versions of
`counter += 1` and `counter -= 1`.

##### ○•○

Loops are said to affect the control flow[](#index-control-flow)
of a program. They change the order in which statements are executed.
In many cases, another kind of flow is useful: skipping statements.

We want to show all numbers between 0 and 20 which are divisible
both by 3 and by 4.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for counter in [0..20]
  if counter % 3 is 0 and counter % 4 is 0
    show counter
~~~~

The keyword `if`[](#index-if) is not too different from the keyword
`while`: It checks the condition it is given, and executes the
statement after it based on this condition. But it does this only
once, so that the statement is executed zero or one time.

The trick with the modulo (`%`[](#index-%)) operator is an easy
way to test whether a number is divisible by another number. If it
is, the remainder of their division, which is what modulo gives
you, is zero.

If we wanted to print all of the numbers between 0 and 20, but put
parentheses around the ones that are not divisible by 4, we can do
it like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for counter in [0..20]
  if counter % 4 is 0
    show counter
  if counter % 4 isnt 0
    show '(' + counter + ')'
~~~~

But now the program has to determine whether `counter` is divisible
by `4` two times. The same effect can be gotten by appending an
`else` part after an `if` statement. The `else`[](#index-else)
statement is executed only when the `if`'s condition is false.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for counter in [0..20]
  if counter % 4 is 0
    show counter
  else
    show '(' + counter + ')'
~~~~

To stretch this trivial example a bit further, we now want to print
these same numbers, but add two stars after them when they are
greater than 15, one star when they are greater than 10 (but not
greater than 15), and no stars otherwise.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for counter in [0..20]
  if counter > 15
    show counter + '**'
  else if counter > 10
    show counter + '*'
  else
    show counter
~~~~

This demonstrates that you can chain `if` statements together. In
this case, the program first looks if `counter` is greater than
`15`. If it is, the two stars are printed and the other tests are
skipped.  If it is not, we continue to check if `counter` is greater
than `10`. Only if `counter` is also not greater than `10` does it
arrive at the last `show` statement.

#### *Exercise 5*

Write a program to ask yourself, using `prompt`, what the value of
2 + 2 is. If the answer is '4', use `show` to say something praising.
If it is '3' or '5', say 'Almost!'. In other cases, say something
mean. Refer [back↑](#prompt) for the little bit of magic needed
with `prompt`.

The logic tests in a program can become complicated. To help write
conditions clearly CoffeeScript provides a couple of variations on
the `if` statement: The body of an `if` statement can be placed
before the condition. And an `if not` can be written as
`unless`[](#index-unless).

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
fun = on
show 'The show is on!' unless fun is off
~~~~

##### ○•○

When a loop does not always have to go all the way through to its
end, the `break`[](#index-break) keyword can be useful. It immediately
jumps out of the current loop, continuing after it. This program
finds the first number that is greater than 20 and divisible by 7:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
current = 20
loop
  if current % 7 is 0
    break
  current++
show current
~~~~

The `loop`[](#index-loop) construct does not have a part that
checks for the end of the loop. It is the same as `while true`.
This means that it is dependent on the `break` statement inside it
to ever stop. The same program could also have been written as
simply…

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
current = 20
current++ until current % 7 is 0
show current
~~~~

In this case, the body of the loop comes before the loop test. The
`until`[](#index-until) keyword is similar to the `unless` keyword,
but translates into `while not`. The only effect of the loop is to
increment the variable `current` to its desired value. But I needed
an example that uses `break`, so pay attention to the first version
too.

#### *Exercise 6*

Pick a lucky number from 1 to 6 then keep rolling a simulated die,
until your lucky number comes up. Count the number of rolls. Use a
loop and optionally a `break`. Casting a die can be simulated with:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
roll = Math.floor Math.random() * 6 + 1
~~~~

Note that `loop` is the same as `while true` and both can be used
to create a loop that does not end on its own account. Writing
`while true` is a useful trick but a bit silly, you ask the program
to loop as long as `true` is `true`, so the preferred way is to
write `loop`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
luckyNumber = 5 # Choose from 1 to 6
show "Your lucky number is #{luckyNumber}"
count = 0
loop
  show roll = Math.floor Math.random() * 6 + 1
  count++
  if roll is luckyNumber then break
show "Luck took #{count} roll(s)"
~~~~

Another solution, arguably nicer, without `break` but abusing
statistics:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
luckyNumber = 3 # Choose from 1 to 6
show 'Your lucky number is ' + luckyNumber
count = 0
until roll is luckyNumber
  show roll = Math.floor Math.random() * 6 + 1
  count++
show 'You are lucky ' +
    Math.floor(100/count) + '% of the time'
~~~~

####

In the second solution to the previous exercise `roll` has not been
set to a value the first time through the loop. It is only assigned
a value in the next statement. What happens when you take the value
of this variable?

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show mysteryVariable
mysteryVariable = 'nothing'
~~~~

In terms of tentacles, this variable ends in thin air, it has nothing
to grasp. When you ask for the value of an empty place, you get a
special value named `undefined`[](#index-undefined). Functions which
do not return an interesting value, such as the `show` function
also return an `undefined` value. Most things in CoffeeScript however
return a value, even most statements.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show show 'I am a side effect.'
~~~~

There is a similar value, `null`[](#index-null), whose meaning is
'this variable is defined, but it does not have a value'. The
difference in meaning between `undefined` and `null` is mostly
academic, and usually not very interesting. In practical programs,
it is often necessary to check whether something 'has a value'. In
these cases, the expression `something?` may be used, the `?`[](#index-?)
is called the existential operator[](#index-existential-operator).
It returns `true` unless something is `null` or `undefined`. It
also comes in an existential assignment form `?=` which will only
assign to a variable that is either `null` or `undefined`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show iam ? undefined
iam ?= 'I want to be'
show iam
iam ?= 'I am already'
show iam if iam?
~~~~

##### ○•○

Which brings us to another subject… If you have been exposed to
JavaScript then you know that comparisons of different types can
be tricky.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show false == 0
show '' == 0
show '5' == 5
~~~~

[](#index-type-conversion)In JavaScript all these give the value
`true` — not so in CoffeeScript where they are all `false`. When
comparing values that have different types, you have to convert
them into compatible types first. We saw this earlier with `Number`
so `Number('5') == 5` gives `true`. The behaviour of `is`/`==` in
CoffeeScript is the same as `===` in JavaScript.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show `null === undefined`
show `false === 0`
show `'' === 0`
show `'5' === 5`
~~~~

All these are `false`. You can embed
JavaScript[](#index-embedded-JavaScript) in CoffeeScript by
surrounding the JavaScript code with backquotes[](#index-backquotes).
Using JavaScript when you have CoffeeScript is similar to embedding
assembly language in a high-level language. It should be something
you very rarely need to do.

##### ○•○

There are some other situations that cause automatic type
conversions[](#index-type-conversion) to happen. If you add a
non-string value to a string, the value is automatically converted
to a string before it is concatenated. If you multiply a number and
a string, CoffeeScript tries to make a number out of the string.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show 'Apollo' + 5
show null + 'ify'
show '5' * 5
show 'strawberry' * 5
~~~~

The last statement prints `NaN`[](#index-NaN), which is a special
value. It stands for 'not a number', and is of type number (which
might sound a little contradictory). In this case, it refers to the
fact that a strawberry is not a number. All arithmetic operations
on the value `NaN` result in `NaN`, which is why multiplying it by
`5`, as in the example, still gives a `NaN` value. Also, and this
can be disorienting at times, `NaN == NaN` equals `false`, checking
whether a value is `NaN` can be done with the `isNaN`[](#index-isNaN)
function.

These automatic conversions can be very convenient, but they are
also rather weird and error prone. Even though `+` and `*` are both
arithmetic operators, they behave completely different in the
example. In my own code, I use `+` on non-strings a lot, but make
it a point not to use `*` and the other numeric operators on string
values.

Converting a number to a string is always possible and straightforward,
but converting a string to a number may not even work (as in the
last line of the example). We can use `Number` to explicitly convert
the string to a number, making it clear that we might run the risk
of getting a `NaN` value.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show Number('5') * 5
~~~~

##### ○•○

When we discussed the boolean operators `and` / `&&` and `or` /
`||` earlier, I claimed they produced boolean values. This turns
out to be a bit of an oversimplification. If you apply them to
boolean values, they will indeed return booleans. But they can also
be applied to other kinds of values, in which case they will return
one of their arguments.

What `or`[](#index---) really does is this: It looks at the value
to the left of it first. If converting this value to a boolean would
produce `true`, it returns this left value, and otherwise it returns
the one on its right. Check for yourself that this does the correct
thing when the arguments are booleans. Why does it work like that?
It turns out this is very practical. Consider this example:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
prompt 'What is your name?', '',
  (input) -> show 'Well hello ' + (input or 'dear')
~~~~

If the user confirms without giving a name, the variable `input`
will hold the value `''`. This would give `false` when converted
to a boolean. The expression `input or 'dear'` can in this case be
read as 'the value of the variable `input`, or else the string
`'dear'`'. It is an easy way to provide a 'fallback' value.

The `and`[](#index-&&) operator works similarly, but the other way
around. When the value to its left is something that would give
`false` when converted to a boolean, it returns that value, and
otherwise it returns the value on its right.

Another property of these two operators is that the expression to
their right is only evaluated when necessary. In the case of `true
or X`, no matter what `X` is, the result will be `true`, so `X` is
never evaluated, and if it has side effects they never happen. The
same goes for `false and X`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
false or show 'I am happening!'
true  or show 'Not me.'

### Functions

* * * * * * * * * *


A program often needs to do the same thing in different places.
Repeating all the necessary statements every time is tedious and
error-prone. It would be better to put them in one place, and have
the program take a detour through there whenever necessary. This
is what functions[](#index-function) were invented for: They are
canned code that a program can go through whenever it wants. Putting
a string on the screen requires quite a few statements, but when
we have a `show` function we can just write `show 'Aleph'` and be
done with it.

To view functions merely as canned chunks of code does not do them
justice though. When needed, they can play the role of pure functions,
algorithms, indirections, abstractions, decisions, modules,
continuations, data structures, and more. Being able to effectively
use functions is a necessary skill for any kind of serious programming.
This chapter provides an introduction into the subject, [Functional
Programming↓](#functional-programming) discusses the subtleties
of functions in more depth.

##### ○•○

[](#index-pure-function)Pure functions, for a start, are the things
that were called functions in the mathematics classes that I hope
you have been subjected to at some point in your life. Taking the
cosine or the absolute value of a number is a pure function of one
argument.  Addition is a pure function of two arguments.

The defining properties of pure functions are that they always
return the same value when given the same arguments, and never have
side effects. They take some arguments, return a value based on
these arguments, and do not monkey around with anything else.

In CoffeeScript, addition is an operator, but it could be wrapped
in a function like this (and as pointless as this looks, we will
come across situations where it is actually useful):

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
add = (a, b) -> a + b
add 2, 2
~~~~

`add` is the name of the function.  `a` and `b` are the names of
the two arguments.  `a + b` is the body of the function.

[](#index--%3E)The construct `->` is used when creating a new
function. When it is assigned to a variable name, the resulting
function will be stored under this name. Before the `->` comes a
list of argument[](#index-argument) names in parentheses. If a
function does not take any arguments, then the parentheses are not
needed. After the `->` follows the body[](#index-body) of the
function. The body can follow the `->` on the same line or indented
on the following line.

[](#index-return)The last statement in a function determines its
value.  The keyword `return`, followed by an expression, can also
be used to determine the value the function returns. When control
comes across a `return` statement, it immediately jumps out of the
current function and gives the returned value to the code that
called the function. A `return` statement without an expression
after it will cause the function to return `undefined`.

A body can, of course, have more than one statement in it. Here is
a function for computing powers (with positive, integer exponents):

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
power = (base, exponent) ->
  result = 1
  for count in [0...exponent]
    result *= base
  result
power 2, 10
~~~~

If you solved [Exercise 2↑](#exercise-2), this technique for computing
a power should look familiar. Creating a variable (`result`) and
updating it are side effects. Did I not just say pure functions had
no side effects? A variable created inside a function exists only
inside the function. This is fortunate, or a programmer would have
to come up with a different name for every variable he needs
throughout a program. Because `result` only exists inside `power`,
the changes to it only last until the function returns, and from
the perspective of code that calls it there are no side effects.

#### *Exercise 7*

Write a function called `absolute`, which returns the absolute value
of the number it is given as its argument. The absolute value of a
negative number is the positive version of that same number, and
the absolute value of a positive number (or zero) is that number
itself.

Pure functions have two very nice properties. They are easy to think
about, and they are easy to re-use.

If a function is pure, a call to it can be seen as a thing in itself.
When you are not sure that it is working correctly, you can test
it by calling it directly from the console, which is simple because
it does not depend on any context[^J]. It is easy to make these
tests automatic — to write a program that tests a specific function.
Non-pure functions might return different values based on all kinds
of factors, and have side effects that might be hard to test and
think about.

[^J]:  Technically, a pure function can not use the value of any
external variables. These values might change, and this could make
the function return a different value for the same arguments. In
practice, the programmer may consider some variables 'constant' —
they are not expected to change — and consider functions that use
only constant variables pure. Variables that contain a function
value are often good examples of constant variables.

Because pure functions are self-sufficient, they are likely to be
useful and relevant in a wider range of situations than non-pure
ones. Take `show`, for example. This function's usefulness depends
on the presence of a special place on the screen for printing output.
If that place is not there, the function is useless. We can imagine
a related function, let's call it `format`, that takes a value as
an argument and returns a string that represents this value. This
function is useful in more situations than `show`.

Of course, `format` does not solve the same problem as `show`, and
no pure function is going to be able to solve that problem, because
it requires a side effect. In many cases, non-pure functions are
precisely what you need. In other cases, a problem can be solved
with a pure function but the non-pure variant is much more convenient
or efficient.

Thus, when something can easily be expressed as a pure function,
write it that way. But never feel dirty for writing non-pure
functions.

##### ○•○

[](#index-testing)How do we make sure that a function gives the
result that we expect? In the last exercise we tried with `absolute
-144` and got the answer we wanted. For a simple function that is
likely enough, but functions quickly become much more complicated
and it becomes difficult to predict the output just from reading
the program text. To reassure ourselves that `absolute` actually
works many more test cases are needed. But typing test case after
test case very quickly becomes very boring — so there must be a
better way…

The exercise described the properties that the function should have
as: _'The absolute value of a negative number is the positive version
of that same number, and the absolute value of a positive number
(or zero) is that number itself.'_ This description can be turned
into properties that the computer can test for us.

The `testAbsolute` function calls on testPure in `qc` — `qc` stands
for quick check[^K] — and tells it in the first argument to test
`absolute`. The next argument, `arbInt`, declare that `absolute`
takes an arbitrary integer as its only argument. Don't worry about
the brackets and dots, they will be explained in the next chapters.
Calling `testAbsolute` with a descriptive name and a property is
all that is needed to tell what to expect of `absolute`.

[^K]: Koen Claessen and John Hughes from Chalmers University of
Technology created QuickCheck for Haskell and its ideas has since
been reimplemented in many other programming languages. The `qc`
library is an implementation for JavaScript by Darrin Thompson. A
CoffeeScript compatible version is included in the interactive
environment.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
runOnDemand -> # Create the Run button further down
  testAbsolute = (name, property) ->
    testPure absolute, [arbInt], name, property

  testAbsolute 'returns positive integers',
    (c, arg, result) ->
      result >= 0

  testAbsolute 'positive returns positive',
    (c, arg, result) ->
      c.guard arg >= 0
      result is arg

  testAbsolute 'negative returns positive',
    (c, arg, result) ->
      c.guard arg < 0
      result is -arg

  test()
~~~~

First from the description of the function, clearly `absolute`
should return a value larger than or equal to zero. That is what
`result >= 0` in the property says. A property here is a function
which is given three arguments; a test case (called `c` since `case`
is a reserved word), the argument that `absolute` was called with
and the `result` it gave back. Based on these values the property
then returns true or false depending on whether the function conformed
to the property.

The description says: 'the absolute value of a positive number (or
zero) is that number itself.' So this property only needs positive
numbers, a call to `guard` can to tell `qc` to disregard values
that are not positive. The property then checks that the `result`
is the same as the argument.  Almost the same goes for negative
arguments, except we use unary minus in the property.

So far only the desired properties of the function has been declared.
No tests have been performed. Calling `test()` at then end starts
the testing process when you press the 'Run' button, `qc` then
generates test data and checks the properties.

That was nice.  `absolute` has passed 300 test cases in the blink
of an eye. The invalid counts comes from the `guard` calls that
throw away test cases. If you want to see the test values then you
can insert a `show c.args` in the property.

So what does it look like if a test fails? The `power` function
from earlier in this chapter is a good candidate for a function
that will fail to live up to expectations. We could reasonably
expect that `power` will behave the same as the standard `Math.pow`
function — but only for integers of course.

  test()
~~~~

Calling `testPure` and describing `power` as a function with two
integer arguments does that. The property is then declaring that
the `result` from `power` is the same as that from `Math.pow`. To
see the value that `Math.pow` returns, a call is made to `c.note`
which registers the value it is given.

That failed and `qc` shows why. The `-9` and `-9` in the last lines
refer to the arguments that `qc` generated for the test case. The
`-387420489` is the result from `power`. The last number is the
value noted from `Math.pow`, it is a close approximation of the
correct answer -9^-9^ = ^-1^/~387420489~

  test()
~~~~

The expectation that `power` works for integers was too broad, but
surely the functions will work the same for positive integers or
what do you think? Instead of using guard to throw away test cases
as before, the description of the arguments can be changed. Many
different argument types are included in `qc` (ranges, strings,
dates, lists, …) and there is also one for positive integers,
`arbWholeNum`.

Well it passed 28 tests before a test case for 27^27^ gave a
difference on the last digit[^L]. Notice the line with `shrinkedArgs`.
When a test fails then `qc` tries to find a simpler test that
reproduces the problem. Simpler can mean shorter strings, lists or
in this case smaller numbers. So `qc` found that there was a
difference already for 9^18^. The result from `power` ends with
`100` and from `Math.pow` with `140`. So which is correct?
None[^M] of them: 9^18^ = 150094635296999121.

[^L]:  The ECMAScript standard allows these deviations for JavaScript
and thus for CoffeeScript. If you should need unlimited precision
integers then either use a third party library or a more mathematically
inclined programming language such as Pure.

[^M]:  Maxima is the source of this result. Maxima is a computer
algebra system that does symbolic and unlimited precision calculations.

#### *Exercise 8*

Modify the function `intensify` in the following program until it
passes the test properties. You can find descriptions of many `qc`
definitions such as `arbConst` in the [`qc` reference↓](#quickcheck).
A predefined function `c.noteVerbose` can help by both recording a
result if the test fails and displaying values as they are tested.

Writing test declarations before writing a function can be a good
way of specifying it. The test declarations in these examples are
much larger than the functions they are testing. In [Binary
Heaps↓](#binary-heaps) is a more realistic example of a class
and tests for it. Declarative testing is well suited to testing
algorithms and reusable libraries. There are many other test tools
that you can choose depending on your preference and task[^N].  The
main point here is that a reasonable level of testing is part of
writing code.

[^N]:  Most JavaScript test tools are compatible with CoffeeScript
or can easily be adapted.

##### ○•○

Back to functions, they do not have to contain a `return` statement.
If no `return` statement is encountered, the function returns the
value of the last statement. The predefined function `view` returns
its argument so that it can be used inside expressions. If you want
the function to return `undefined` then the last statement can be
a `return`.[^show]

[^show]: Such a function is already present, it is `show`.

The names of the arguments of a function are available as variables
inside it. They will refer to the values of the arguments the
function is being called with, and like normal variables created
inside a function, they do not exist outside it. Aside from the
top-level environment[](#index-top-level-environment), there are
smaller, local environments[](#index-local-environment) created
by functions. When looking up a variable inside a function, the
outer environment is checked first, and only if the variable does
not exist there is it created in the local environment.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
dino = 'I am alive'
reptile = 'I am A-OK'
meteor = (reptile) ->
  show reptile            # Argument
  dino = 'I am extinct'
  reptile = 'I survived'
  possum = 'I am new'
show dino                 # Outer
meteor 'What happened?'
show dino                 # Outer changed
show reptile              # Outer unchanged
try show possum catch e
  show e.message          # Error undefined
~~~~

This makes it possible for arguments to a function to
'shadow'[](#index-shadow) outer level variables that have the same
name. The easiest way to deal with variables is to use unique names
for variables throughout a file. In [Modularity↓](#modularity)
you will see that the top-level is not shared between files unless
variables are specifically exported.

![figure ../img/environments-small.png](../img/environments-small.png)\


So if the name of variable in an inner function exists in an outer
environment then the variable is referring to the outer one, it is
not a new definition. That is an expression like
`variable = 'something'` may be a definition of a new variable or
it may be an assignment to a previously defined variable. As a
matter of style, when you are using top-level variables then it
makes sense to introduce them at the top of a file with a default
value.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
variable = 'first'                    # Definition

showVariable = ->
  show 'In showVariable, the variable holds: ' +
        variable                      # second

testIt = ->
  variable = 'second'                 # Assignment
  show 'In test, the variable holds ' +
       variable + '.'                 # second
  showVariable()

show 'The variable is: ' + variable   # first
testIt()
show 'The variable is: ' + variable   # second
~~~~

The variables defined in the local environment are only visible to
the code inside the function. If a function calls another function,
the newly called function does not see the variables inside the
first function.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
andHere = ->
  try show aLocal                     # Not defined
  catch e then show e.message
isHere = ->
  aLocal = 'aLocal is defined'
  andHere()
isHere()
~~~~

However, and this is a subtle but extremely useful phenomenon, when
a function is defined *inside* another function, its local environment
will be based on the local environment that surrounds it.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
isHere = ->
  andHere = ->
    try show aLocal                   # Is defined
    catch e then show e.message
  aLocal = 'aLocal is defined'
  andHere()
isHere()

Here is a special case that might surprise you:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
varWhich = 'top-level'
parentFunction = ->
  varWhich = 'local'
  childFunction = ->
    show varWhich
  childFunction
child = parentFunction()
child()
~~~~

`parentFunction` *returns* its internal function, and the code at
the bottom calls this function. Even though `parentFunction` has
finished executing at this point, the local environment where
`variable` has the value `'local'` still exists, and `childFunction`
still uses it. This phenomenon is called closure[](#index-closure).

##### ○•○

With scoping we can 'synthesise' functions. By using some of the
variables from an enclosing function, an inner function can be made
to do different things. Imagine we need a few different but similar
functions, one that adds 2 to its argument, one that adds 5, and
so on.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
makeAddFunction = (amount) ->
  add = (number) -> number + amount

addTwo = makeAddFunction 2
addFive = makeAddFunction 5
show addTwo(1) + addFive(1)
~~~~

##### ○•○

On top of the fact that different functions can contain variables
of the same name without getting tangled up, these scoping rules
also allow functions to call *themselves* without running into
problems. A function that calls itself is called recursive.
Recursion[](#index-recursion) allows for some interesting definitions.
When you define recursive functions the first thing you need is a
stop condition, otherwise your recursive function becomes an elaborate
but never ending loop. Look at this implementation of `power`:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
powerRec = (base, exponent) ->
  if exponent is 0
    1
  else
    base * powerRec base, exponent - 1
show 'power 3, 3 = ' + powerRec 3, 3
~~~~

This is rather close to the way mathematicians define exponentiation,
and to me it looks a lot nicer than the earlier version. It sort
of loops, but there is no `while`, `for`, or even a local side
effect to be seen. By calling itself, the function produces the
same effect. The stop condition is when `exponent` becomes `0` and
the `exponent - 1` ensures that `exponent` gets closer to `0` for
each call. Note the assumption that exponent is a positive integer,
that should be clearly documented if `powerRec` was a part of a
reusable library.

Does this elegance affect performance? There is only one way to
know for sure: measure it. The timings below are from my machine,
you should not rely much on those. CPU's, operating systems, compilers
and interpreters in browsers all has an effect on performance, so
measure in something that is as close to your target environment
as possible.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}

  start = new Date()

[](#index-efficiency)The dilemma of speed versus
elegance[](#index-elegance) is an interesting one. It not only
occurs when deciding for or against recursion. In many situations,
an elegant, intuitive, and often short solution can be replaced by
a more convoluted but faster solution.

In the case of the `power` function above the un-elegant version
is still sufficiently simple and easy to read. It does not make
very much sense to replace it with the recursive version. Often,
though, the concepts a program is dealing with get so complex that
giving up some efficiency in order to make the program more
straightforward becomes an attractive choice.

The basic rule, which has been repeated by many programmers and
with which I wholeheartedly agree, is not to worry about efficiency
until your program is provably too slow. When it is, find out which
parts are too slow, and start exchanging elegance for efficiency
in those parts.

Of course, the above rule does not mean one should start ignoring
performance altogether. In many cases, like the `power` function,
not much simplicity is gained by the 'elegant' approach. In other
cases, an experienced programmer can see right away that a simple
approach is never going to be fast enough.

The reason I am making a big deal out of this is that surprisingly
many programmers focus fanatically on efficiency, even in the
smallest details. The result is bigger, more complicated, and often
less correct programs, which take longer to write than their more
straightforward equivalents and often run only marginally faster.

When you have a simple, correct implementation that is too slow,
then you can use that as a reference implementation to test your
improved version. The one thing you do need to consider up front
is what kind of data structures and algorithms can handle the task
at hand. There is a huge difference between searching in a list
with ten items and searching in a list with millions of items. These
kind of considerations are covered in more detail in
[Searching↓](#searching).

##### ○•○

But I was talking about recursion. A concept closely related to
recursion is a thing called the stack[](#index-stack). When a
function is called, control is given to the body of that function.
When that body returns, the code that called the function is resumed.
While the body is running, the computer must remember the context
from which the function was called, so that it knows where to
continue afterwards. The place where this context is stored is
called the stack.

The fact that it is called 'stack' has to do with the fact that,
as we saw, a function body can again call a function. Every time a
function is called, another context has to be stored. One can
visualise this as a stack of contexts. Every time a function is
called, the current context is thrown on top of the stack. When a
function returns, the context on top is taken off the stack and
resumed.

This stack requires space in the computer's memory to be stored.
When the stack grows too big, the computer will give up with a
message like “out of stack space” or “too much recursion”. This is
something that has to be kept in mind when writing recursive
functions.

In addition to demonstrating a very interesting way of writing a
broken program, this example shows that a function does not have
to call itself directly to be recursive. If it calls another function
which (directly or indirectly) calls the first function again, it
is still recursive.  The `try` and `catch` parts are covered in
[Error Handling↓](#error-handling).

Recursion is not always just a less-efficient alternative to looping.
Some problems are much easier to solve with recursion than with
loops.  Most often these are problems that require exploring or
processing several 'branches', each of which might branch out again
into more branches.

Consider this puzzle: By starting from the number 1 and repeatedly
either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite amount of new
numbers can be produced. How would you write a function that, given
a number, tries to find a sequence of additions and multiplications
that produce that number?

For example, the number 13 could be reached by first multiplying 1
by 3, and then adding 5 twice. The number 15 can not be reached at
all.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
findSequence = (goal) ->
  find = (start, history) ->
    if start is goal
      history
    else if start > goal
      null
    else
      find(start + 5, '(' + history + ' + 5)') ? \
      find(start * 3, '(' + history + ' * 3)')
  find 1, '1'
show findSequence 24
~~~~

Note that the solution does not necessarily find the *shortest*
sequence of operations, it is satisfied when it finds any sequence
at all.

The inner `find` function, by calling itself in two different ways,
explores both the possibility of adding 5 to the current number and
of multiplying it by 3. When it finds the number, it returns the
`history` string, which is used to record all the operators that
were performed to get to this number. It also checks whether the
current number is bigger than `goal`, because if it is, we should
stop exploring this branch, it is not going to give us our number.

The use of the existential `?` operator in the example can be read
as 'return the solution found by adding 5 to `start`, and if that
fails, return the solution found by multiplying `start` by 3'.

##### ○•○

Usually when you define a function you assign it to a name that you
can use to refer to it later. That is not required and sometimes
it is not worthwhile to give a function a name, then you can use
an anonymous function[](#index-anonymous-function) instead.

Like in the `makeAddFunction` example we saw earlier:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
makeAddFunction = (amount) ->
  (number) -> number + amount

show makeAddFunction(11) 3
~~~~

Since the function named `add` in the first version of `makeAddFunction`
was referred to only once, the name does not serve any purpose and
we might as well directly return the function value.

#### *Exercise 9*

Write a function `greaterThan`, which takes one argument, a number,
and returns a function that represents a test. When this returned
function is called with a single number as argument, it returns a
boolean: `true` if the given number is greater than the number that
was used to create the test function, and `false` otherwise.

Try the following:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
yell 'Hello', 'Good Evening', 'How do you do?'

The function `yell` defined earlier in this chapter only accepts
one argument. Yet when you call it like this, the computer does not
complain at all, but just ignores the other arguments.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
yell()
~~~~

You can, apparently, even get away with passing too few arguments.
When an argument is not passed, its value inside the function is
`undefined`.

In the next chapter, we will see a way in which a function body can
get at the exact list of arguments that were passed to it. This can
be useful, as it makes it possible to have a function accept any
number of arguments. A debugging function `console.log` makes use
of this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
console?.log 'R', 2, 'D', 2
~~~~

To see the output from `console.log` you have to enable and open
your browser's built-in developer tools.  The question mark is to
prevent Internet Explorer 9 from throwing an error if Developer
Tools (F12) has not been activated.

Of course, the downside of a variable number of arguments is that
it is also possible to accidentally pass the wrong number of arguments
to functions that expect a fixed amount of them and never be told
about it.

### Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

* * * * * * * * * *


This chapter will be devoted to solving a few simple problems. In
the process, we will discuss two new types of values, arrays and
objects, and look at some techniques related to them.

Consider the following situation: Your crazy aunt Emily, who is
rumoured to have over fifty cats living with her (you never managed
to count them), regularly sends you e-mails to keep you up to date
on her exploits. They usually look like this:

> *Dear nephew,*\
>  *Your mother told me you have taken up skydiving. Is this true? You
> watch yourself, young man! Remember what happened to my husband? And
> that was only from the second floor!*\
>  *Anyway, things are very exciting here. I have spent all week trying
> to get the attention of Mr. Drake, the nice gentleman who moved in
> next door, but I think he is afraid of cats. Or allergic to them? I am
> going to try putting Fat Igor on his shoulder next time I see him,
> very curious what will happen.*\
>  *Also, the scam I told you about is going better than expected. I
> have already gotten back five 'payments', and only one complaint. It
> is starting to make me feel a bit bad though. And you are right that
> it is probably illegal in some way.*

> *(*…*etc*…*)*

> *Much love,*\
>  *Aunt Emily*\
>  *died 27/04/2006: Black Leclère*\
>  *born 05/04/2006 (mother Lady Penelope): Red Lion, Doctor Hobbles the
> 3rd, Little Iroquois*

To humour the old dear, you would like to keep track of the genealogy
of her cats, so you can add things like “P.S. I hope Doctor Hobbles
the 2nd enjoyed his birthday this Saturday!”, or “How is old Lady
Penelope doing? She's five years old now, isn't she?”, preferably
without accidentally asking about dead cats. You are in the possession
of a large quantity of old e-mails from your aunt, and fortunately
she is very consistent in always putting information about the cats'
births and deaths at the end of her mails in precisely the same
format.

You are hardly inclined to go through all those mails by hand.
Fortunately, we were just in need of an example problem, so we will
try to work out a program that does the work for us. For a start,
we write a program that gives us a list of cats that are still alive
after the last e-mail.

Before you ask, at the start of the correspondence, aunt Emily had
only a single cat: Spot. (She was still rather conventional in those
days.)

![figure ../img/eyes-small.jpg](../img/eyes-small.jpg)\


It usually pays to have some kind of clue what one's program is
going to do before starting to type. Here's a plan:

1.  Start with a set of cat names that has only “Spot” in it.
2.  Go over every e-mail in our archive, in chronological order.
3.  Look for paragraphs that start with “born” or “died”.
4.  Add the names from paragraphs that start with “born” to our set of
    names.
5.  Remove the names from paragraphs that start with “died” from our
    set.

Where taking the names from a paragraph goes like this:

1.  Find the colon in the paragraph.
2.  Take the part after this colon.
3.  Split this part into separate names by looking for commas.

It may require some suspension of disbelief to accept that aunt
Emily always used this exact format, and that she never forgot or
misspelled a name, but that is just how your aunt is.

##### ○•○

First, let me tell you about properties[](#index-properties). A
lot of CoffeeScript values have other values associated with them.
These associations are called properties. Every string has a property
called `length`[](#index-length), which refers to a number, the
amount of characters in that string.

[](#index-[])Properties can be accessed in two ways:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
text = 'purple haze'
show text['length']
show text.length
~~~~

The second way is a shorthand for the first, and it only works when
the name of the property would be a valid variable name — when it
does not have any spaces or symbols in it and does not start with
a digit character.

Numbers, booleans, the value `null`, and the value `undefined` do
not have any properties. Trying to read properties from such a value
produces an error. Try the following code, if only to get an idea
about the kind of error-message you get in such a case (which, for
some browsers, can be rather cryptic).

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
nothing = null
try show nothing.length catch error then show error.message
~~~~

The properties of a string value can not be changed. There are quite
a few more than just `length`, as we will see, but you are not
allowed to add or remove any.

This is different with values of the type object[](#index-object).
Their main role is to hold other values. They have, you could say,
their own set of tentacles in the form of properties. You are free
to modify these, remove them, or add new ones.

[](#index-%7B%7D)An object can be written like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
cat =
  colour: 'grey'
  name: 'Spot'
  size: 46
# Or: cat = {colour: 'grey', name: 'Spot', size: 46}
cat.size = 47
show cat.size
delete cat.size
show cat.size
show cat
~~~~

Like variables, each property attached to an object is labelled by
a string. The first statement creates an object in which the property
`'colour'` holds the string `'grey'`, the property `'name'` is
attached to the string `'Spot'`, and the property `'size'` refers
to the number `46`. The second statement gives the property named
`size` a new value, which is done in the same way as modifying a
variable.

The keyword `delete`[](#index-delete) cuts off properties. Trying
to read a non-existent property gives the value `undefined`.

If a property that does not yet exist is set with the `=`[](#index-=)
operator, it is added to the object.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
empty = {}
empty.notReally = 1000
show empty.notReally
~~~~

Properties whose names are not valid variable names have to be quoted
when creating the object, and approached using brackets:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
thing = {'gabba gabba': 'hey', '5': 10}
show thing['5']
thing['5'] = 20
show thing[2 + 3]
delete thing['gabba gabba']
show thing
~~~~

As you can see, the part between the brackets can be any expression.
It is converted to a string to determine the property name it refers
to.  One can even use variables to name properties:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
propertyName = 'length'
text = 'mainline'
show text[propertyName]
~~~~

The operator `of`[](#index-of) can be used to test whether an
object has a certain property. It produces a boolean.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
chineseBox = {}
chineseBox.content = chineseBox
show 'content' of chineseBox
show 'content' of chineseBox.content
show chineseBox
~~~~

##### ○•○

When object values are shown in the interactive environment, all
layers of properties are shown. You can give an extra boolean
argument, `shallow`, to `show` to only its `own` top-most properties.
This is also used to limit the display of objects with circular
references such as for the `chineseBox` above.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
abyss = {lets:1, go:deep:down:into:the:abyss:7}

#### *Exercise 10*

The solution for the cat problem talks about a 'set' of names. A
set[](#index-set) is a collection of values in which no value may
occur more than once. If names are strings, can you think of a way
to use an object to represent a set of names?

Show how a name can be added to this set, how one can be removed,
and how you can check whether a name occurs in it.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}

##### View Solution
######

This can be done by storing the content of the set as the properties
of an object. Adding a name is done by setting a property by that
name to a value, any value. Removing a name is done by deleting
this property. The `of` operator can be used to determine whether
a certain name is part of the set. There are a few subtle problems
with this approach, which will be discussed and solved in [Object
Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming).  For this chapter, it
works well enough.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
set = {'Spot': true}
# Add 'White Fang' to the set
set['White Fang'] = true
# Remove 'Spot'
delete set['Spot']
# See if 'Asoka' is in the set
show 'Asoka' of set

####

[](#index-mutability)Object values, apparently, can change. The
types of values discussed in [Basic CoffeeScript↑](#basic-coffeescript)
are all immutable, it is impossible to change an existing value of
those types. You can combine them and derive new values from them,
but when you take a specific string value, the text inside it can
not change.  With objects, on the other hand, the content of a value
can be modified by changing its properties.

When we have two numbers, `120` and `120`, they can for all practical
purposes be considered the precise same number. With objects, there
is a difference between having two references to the same object
and having two different objects that contain the same properties.
Consider the following code:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
object1 = {value: 10}
object2 = object1
object3 = {value: 10}

show object1 is object2
show object1 is object3

object1.value = 15
show object2.value
show object3.value
~~~~

`object1` and `object2` are two variables grasping the *same* value.
There is only one actual object, which is why changing `object1`
also changes the value of `object2`. The variable `object3` points
to another object, which initially contains the same properties as
`object1`, but lives a separate life.

CoffeeScript's `is`/`==`[](#index-==) operator, when comparing objects,
will only return `true` if both values given to it are the precise
same value. Comparing different object with identical contents will
give `false`. This is useful in some situations, but unpractical
in others[^O].

[^O]: In the underscore library you can find a function `isEqual`
which compares two objects based on all layers of their contents.

##### ○•○

Object values can play a lot of different roles. Behaving like a
set is only one of those. We will see a few other roles in this
chapter, and [Object Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming)
shows another important way of using objects.

In the plan for the cat problem — in fact, call it an *algorithm*,
not a plan, that makes it sound like we know what we are talking
about — in the algorithm, it talks about going over all the e-mails
in an archive.  What does this archive look like? And where does
it come from?

Do not worry about the second question for now. [Modularity↓](#modularity)
talks about some ways to import data into your programs, but for
now you will find that the e-mails are just magically there. Some
magic is really easy, inside computers.

##### ○•○

The way in which the archive is stored is still an interesting
question.  It contains a number of e-mails. An e-mail can be a
string, that should be obvious. The whole archive could be put into
one huge string, but that is hardly practical. What we want is a
collection of separate strings.

Collections of things are what objects are used for. One could make
an object like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
mailArchive = {
  'the first e-mail': 'Dear nephew, ...'
  'the second e-mail': '...'
  # and so on ...
}
~~~~

But that makes it hard to go over the e-mails from start to end —
how does the program guess the name of these properties? This can
be solved by more predictable property names:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
mailArchive = {
  0: 'Dear nephew, ... (mail number 1)'
  1: '(mail number 2)'
  2: '(mail number 3)'
}

for current of mailArchive
  show 'Processing e-mail #' + current +
       ': ' + mailArchive[current]
~~~~

Luck has it that there is a special kind of objects specifically
for this kind of use. They are called arrays[](#index-array), and
they provide some conveniences, such as a `length`[](#index-length)
property that contains the amount of values in the array, and a
number of operations useful for this kind of collections.

[](#index-[])New arrays can be created using brackets (`[` and
`]`). As with properties, the commas between elements are optional
when they are placed on separate lines. Ranges and for comprehensions
also create arrays.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
mailArchive = ['mail one', 'mail two', 'mail three']

for current in [0...mailArchive.length]
  show 'Processing e-mail #' + current +
       ': ' + mailArchive[current]
~~~~

In this example, the numbers of the elements are not specified
explicitly anymore. The first one automatically gets the number 0,
the second the number 1, and so on.

Why start at 0? People tend to start counting from 1. As unintuitive
as it seems, numbering the elements in a collection from 0 is often
more practical. Just go with it for now, it will grow on you.

Starting at element 0 also means that in a collection with `X`
elements, the last element can be found at position `X - 1`. This
is why the `for` loop in the example uses an exclusive range
`0...mailArchive.length`. There is no element at position
`mailArchive.length`, so as soon as `current` has that value, we
stop looping.

#### *Exercise 11*

Write a function `range` that takes one argument, a positive number,
and returns an array containing all numbers from 0 up to and including
the given number.

An empty array can be created by simply typing `[]`. Also remember
that adding properties to an object, and thus also to an array, can
be done by assigning them a value with the `=` operator.  The
`length` property is automatically updated when elements are added.

~~~~

Instead of naming the loop variable `counter` or `current`, as I
have been doing so far, it is now called simply `i`. Using single
letters, usually `i`, `j`, or `k` for loop variables is a widely
spread habit among programmers. It has its origin mostly in laziness:
We'd rather type one character than seven, and names like `counter`
and `current` do not really clarify the meaning of the variable
much.

If a program uses too many meaningless single-letter variables, it
can become unbelievably confusing. In my own programs, I try to
only do this in a few common cases. Small loops are one of these
cases. If the loop contains another loop, and that one also uses a
variable named `i`, the inner loop will modify the variable that
the outer loop is using, and everything will break. One could use
`j` for the inner loop, but in general, when the body of a loop is
big, you should come up with a variable name that has some clear
meaning.

In CoffeeScript the solution can be written in much shorter forms
using a for expression that collects the results or by using the
built-in range.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
range = (upto) -> i for i in [0..upto]
show range 4
range = (upto) -> [0..upto]
show range 4
~~~~

####

In CoffeeScript most statements can also be used as expressions.
That means for example that the values from a for comprehension can
be collected in a variable and used later.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
numbers = (number for number in [0..12] by 2)
show numbers
~~~~

##### ○•○

Both string and array objects contain, in addition to the `length`
property, a number of properties that refer to function values.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
doh = 'Doh'
show typeof doh.toUpperCase
show doh.toUpperCase()
~~~~

Every string has a `toUpperCase`[](#index-toUpperCase) property.
When called, it will return a copy of the string, in which all
letters have been converted to uppercase. There is also
`toLowerCase`[](#index-toLowerCase). Guess what that does.

Notice that, even though the call to `toUpperCase` does not pass
any arguments, the function does somehow have access to the string
`'Doh'`, the value of which it is a property. How this works precisely
is described in [Object Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming).

Properties that contain functions are generally called
methods[](#index-method), for example '`toUpperCase` is a method
of a string object'.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
mack = []
mack.push 'Mack'
mack.push 'the'
mack.push 'Knife'
show mack.join ' '
show mack.pop()
show mack
~~~~

The method `push`[](#index-push), which is associated with arrays,
can be used to add values to it. It could have been used in the
last exercise, as an alternative to `result[i] = i`. Then there is
`pop`[](#index-pop), the opposite of `push`: it takes off and
returns the last value in the array.  `join`[](#index-join) builds
a single big string from an array of strings.  The parameter it is
given is pasted between the values in the array.

##### ○•○

Coming back to those cats, we now know that an array would be a
good way to store the archive of e-mails. In this book, the
`retrieveMails` after the `require` can be used to (magically) get
hold of this array. The magic will be dispelled in
[Modularity↓](#modularity).

Going over them to process them one after another is no rocket
science anymore either:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
mailArchive = retrieveMails()

for email, i in mailArchive
  show "Processing e-mail ##{i} #{email[0..15]}..."
  # Do more things...
~~~~

In a `for ... in` statement we can get both the value and its index
in the array. The `email[0..15]` gets the first snippet of each
email. We have also decided on a way to represent the set of cats
that are alive. The next problem, then, is to find the paragraphs
in an e-mail that start with `'born'` or `'died'`.

##### ○•○

The first question that comes up is what exactly a paragraph is.
In this case, the string value itself can not help us much:
CoffeeScript's concept of text does not go any deeper than the
'sequence of characters' idea, so we must define paragraphs in those
terms.

Earlier, we saw that there is such a thing as a newline character.
These are what most people use to split paragraphs. We consider a
paragraph, then, to be a part of an e-mail that starts at a newline
character or at the start of the content, and ends at the next
newline character or at the end of the content.

And we do not even have to write the algorithm for splitting a
string into paragraphs ourselves. Strings already have a method
named `split`[](#index-split), which is (almost) the opposite of
the `join` method of arrays. It splits a string into an array, using
the string given as its argument to determine in which places to
cut.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
words = 'Cities of the Interior'
show words.split ' '
~~~~

Thus, cutting on newlines (`'\n'`), can be used to split an e-mail
into paragraphs.

#### *Exercise 12*

`split` and `join` are not precisely each other's inverse.
`string.split(x).join(x)` always produces the original value, but
`array.join(x).split(x)` does not. Can you give an example of an
array where `.join(' ').split(' ')` produces a different value?

array = ['a', 'b', 'c d']

~~~~

####

Paragraphs that do not start with either “born” or “died” can be
ignored by the program. How do we test whether a string starts with
a certain word? The method `charAt`[](#index-charAt) can be used
to get a specific character from a string. `x.charAt(0)` gives the
first character, `1` is the second one, and so on. One way to check
whether a string starts with “born” is:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
paragraph = 'born 15-11-2003 (mother Spot): White Fang'
show paragraph.charAt(0) is 'b' and
     paragraph.charAt(1) is 'o' and
     paragraph.charAt(2) is 'r' and
     paragraph.charAt(3) is 'n'
~~~~

But that gets a bit clumsy — imagine checking for a word of ten
characters. There is something to be learned here though: when a
line gets ridiculously long, it can be spread over multiple lines.
The result can be made easier to read by lining up the start of the
new line with the first element on the original line that plays a
similar role. You can also end a line with `\` to indicate that it
continues on the next line.

Strings also have a method called `slice`[](#index-slice). It
copies out a piece of the string, starting from the character at
the position given by the first argument, and ending before (not
including) the character at the position given by the second one.
It is the same as using a range as an index. This allows the check
to be written in a shorter way.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show paragraph.slice(0, 4) is 'born'
show paragraph[0...4] is 'born'
~~~~

#### *Exercise 13*

Write a function called `startsWith` that takes two arguments, both
strings. It returns `true` when the first argument starts with the
characters in the second argument, and `false` otherwise.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
startsWith = (string, pattern) ->
  string.slice(0, pattern.length) is pattern
# or
startsWith = (string, pattern) ->
  string[0...pattern.length] is pattern
show startsWith 'rotation', 'rot'
~~~~

####

What happens when `charAt`, `slice` or a range are used to take a
piece of a string that does not exist?  Will the `startsWith` still
work when the pattern is longer than the string it is matched
against?


~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show 'Pip'.charAt 250
show 'Nop'.slice 1, 10
show 'Pin'[1...10]
~~~~

`charAt` will return `''` when there is no character at the given
position, and `slice` or the range will simply leave out the part
of the new string that does not exist.

So yes, `startsWith` should work. When `startsWith('Idiots', 'Most
honoured colleagues')` is called, the call to `slice` will, because
`string` does not have enough characters, always return a string
that is shorter than `pattern`. Because of that, the comparison
with `is` will return `false`, which is correct.

It helps to always take a moment to consider abnormal (but valid)
inputs for a program. These are usually called corner
cases[](#index-corner-case), and it is very common for programs
that work perfectly on all the 'normal' inputs to screw up on corner
cases[^P].

[^P]:  Some test cases for `startsWith` are present in the source
code file for this chapter.

##### ○•○

The only part of the cat-problem that is still unsolved is the
extraction of names from a paragraph. The algorithm was this:

1.  Find the colon in the paragraph.
2.  Take the part after this colon.
3.  Split this part into separate names by looking for commas.

This has to happen both for paragraphs that start with `'died'`,
and paragraphs that start with `'born'`. It would be a good idea
to put it into a function, so that the two pieces of code that
handle these different kinds of paragraphs can both use it.

#### *Exercise 14*

Can you write a function `catNames` that takes a paragraph as an
argument and returns an array of names?

Strings have an `indexOf`[](#index-indexOf) method that can be
used to find the (first) position of a character or sub-string
within that string. Also, when `slice` is given only one argument,
it will return the part of the string from the given position all
the way to the end. With a range either the start or end can be
left out: `'shorthand'[...5]` ⇒ `'short'` and `'shorthand'[5...]`
⇒ `'hand'`.

It can be helpful to use CoffeeScript interactively to 'explore'
functions. Try `'foo: bar'.indexOf(':')` and see what you get.

              'Doctor Hobbles the 2nd, Noog'
~~~~

The tricky part, which the original description of the algorithm
ignored, is dealing with spaces after the colon and the commas. The
`+ 2` used when slicing the string is needed to leave out the colon
itself and the space after it. The argument to `split` contains
both a comma and a space, because that is what the names are really
separated by, rather than just a comma.

This function does not do any checking for problems. We assume, in
this case, that the input is always correct.

#### 

All that remains now is putting the pieces together. One way to do
that looks like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
mailArchive = retrieveMails()
livingCats = 'Spot': true

for email, i in mailArchive
  paragraphs = email.split '\n'
  for paragraph in paragraphs
    if startsWith paragraph, 'born'
      names = catNames paragraph
      for name in names
        livingCats[name] = true
    else if startsWith paragraph, 'died'
      names = catNames paragraph
      for name in names
        delete livingCats[name]

show livingCats, on
~~~~

That is quite a big dense chunk of code. We will look into making
it a bit lighter in a moment. But first let us look at our results.
We know how to check whether a specific cat survives:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
if 'Spot' in livingCats
  show 'Spot lives!'
else
  show 'Good old Spot, may she rest in peace.'
~~~~

But how do we list all the cats that are alive? The `of`[](#index-of)
keyword is somewhat similar to the `in` keyword when it is used
together with `for`:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for cat of livingCats
  show cat
~~~~

A loop like that will go over the names of the properties in an
object, which allows us to enumerate all the names in our set.

##### ○•○

Some pieces of code look like an impenetrable jungle. The example
solution to the cat problem suffers from this. One way to make some
light shine through it is to just add some strategic blank lines.
This makes it look better, but does not really solve the problem.

What is needed here is to break the code up. We already wrote two
helper functions, `startsWith` and `catNames`, which both take care
of a small, understandable part of the problem.  Let us continue
doing this.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
addToSet = (set, values) ->
  for i in [0..values.length]
    set[values[i]] = true

removeFromSet = (set, values) ->
  for i in [0..values.length]
    delete set[values[i]]
~~~~

These two functions take care of the adding and removing of names
from the set. That already cuts out the two most inner loops from
the solution:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
livingCats = 'Spot': true

for email in mailArchive
  paragraphs = email.split '\n'
  for paragraph in paragraphs
    if startsWith paragraph, 'born'
      addToSet livingCats, catNames paragraph
    else if startsWith paragraph, 'died'
      removeFromSet livingCats, catNames paragraph

show livingCats, on
~~~~

Quite an improvement, if I may say so myself.

Why do `addToSet` and `removeFromSet` take the set as an argument?
They could use the variable `livingCats` directly, if they wanted
to. The reason is that this way they are not completely tied to our
current problem. If `addToSet` directly changed `livingCats`, it
would have to be called `addCatsToCatSet`, or something similar.
The way it is now, it is a more generally useful tool.

Even if we are never going to use these functions for anything else,
which is quite probable, it is useful to write them like this.
Because they are 'self sufficient', they can be read and understood
on their own, without needing to know about some external variable
called `livingCats`.

The functions are not pure: They change the object passed as their
`set` argument. This makes them slightly trickier than real pure
functions, but still a lot less confusing than functions that run
amok and change any value or variable they please.

##### ○•○

We continue breaking the algorithm into pieces:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
findLivingCats = ->
  mailArchive = retrieveMails()
  livingCats = 'Spot': true

  handleParagraph = (paragraph) ->
    if startsWith paragraph, 'born'
      addToSet livingCats, catNames paragraph
    else if startsWith paragraph, 'died'
      removeFromSet livingCats, catNames paragraph

  for email in mailArchive
    paragraphs = email.split '\n'
    for paragraph in paragraphs
      handleParagraph paragraph

  livingCats

howMany = 0
for cat of findLivingCats()
  howMany++
show 'There are ' + howMany + ' cats.'
~~~~

The whole algorithm is now encapsulated by a function. This means
that it does not leave a mess after it runs: `livingCats` is now a
local variable in the function, instead of a top-level one, so it
only exists while the function runs. The code that needs this set
can call `findLivingCats` and use the value it returns.

It seemed to me that making `handleParagraph` a separate function
also cleared things up. But this one is so closely tied to the
cat-algorithm that it is meaningless in any other situation.  On
top of that, it needs access to the `livingCats` variable. Thus,
it is a perfect candidate to be a function-inside-a-function. When
it lives inside `findLivingCats`, it is clear that it is only
relevant there, and it has access to the variables of its parent
function.

This solution is actually *bigger* than the previous one. Still,
it is tidier and I hope you will agree that it is easier to read.

##### ○•○

The program still ignores a lot of the information that is contained
in the e-mails. There are birth-dates, dates of death, and the names
of mothers in there.

To start with the dates: What would be a good way to store a date?
We could make an object with three properties, `year`, `month`, and
`day`, and store numbers in them.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
whenWasIt = year: 1980, month: 2, day: 1
~~~~

But CoffeeScript already provides a kind of object for this purpose.
Such an object can be created by using the keyword `new`[](#index-new):

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
whenWasIt = new Date 1980, 1, 1
show whenWasIt
~~~~

Just like the notation with colons and optional braces we have
already seen, `new` is a way to create object values. Instead of
specifying all the property names and values, a function is used
to build up the object. This makes it possible to define a kind of
standard procedure for creating objects.  Functions like this are
called constructors[](#index-constructor), and in [Object
Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming) we will see how to write
them.

The `Date`[](#index-Date) constructor can be used in different
ways.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show new Date
show new Date 1980, 1, 1
show new Date 2007, 2, 30, 8, 20, 30
~~~~

As you can see, these objects can store a time of day as well as a
date.  When not given any arguments, an object representing the
current time and date is created. Arguments can be given to ask for
a specific date and time. The order of the arguments is year, month,
day, hour, minute, second, milliseconds. These last four are optional,
they become 0 when not given.

The month numbers these objects use go from 0 to 11, which can be
confusing. Especially since day numbers *do* start from 1.

##### ○•○

The content of a `Date` object can be inspected with a number of
`get...` methods.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
today = new Date();
show "Year: #{today.getFullYear()}
 month: #{today.getMonth()}
 day: #{today.getDate()}"
show "Hour: #{today.getHours()}
 minutes: #{today.getMinutes()}
 seconds: #{today.getSeconds()}"
show "Day of week: #{today.getDay()}"
~~~~

All of these, except for `getDay`, also have a `set...` variant
that can be used to change the value of the date object.

Inside the object, a date is represented by the amount of milliseconds
it is away from January 1st 1970. You can imagine this is quite a
large number.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
today = new Date()
show today.getTime()
~~~~

A very useful thing to do with dates is comparing them.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
wallFall = new Date 1989, 10, 9
gulfWarOne = new Date 1990, 6, 2
show wallFall < gulfWarOne
show wallFall is wallFall
# but
show wallFall is new Date 1989, 10, 9
~~~~

Comparing dates with `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` does exactly what you
would expect. When a date object is compared to itself with `is`
the result is `true`, which is also good. But when `is`[](#index-==)
is used to compare a date object to a different, equal date object,
we get `false`. Huh?

As mentioned earlier, `is` will return `false` when comparing two
different objects, even if they contain the same properties. This
is a bit clumsy and error-prone here, since one would expect `>=`
and `is` to behave in a more or less similar way. Testing whether
two dates are equal can be done like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
wallFall1 = new Date 1989, 10, 9
wallFall2 = new Date 1989, 10, 9
show wallFall1.getTime() is wallFall2.getTime()
~~~~

##### ○•○

In addition to a date and time, `Date` objects also contain information
about a timezone[](#index-timezone).  When it is one o'clock in
Amsterdam, it can, depending on the time of year, be noon in London,
and seven in the morning in New York. Such times can only be compared
when you take their time zones into account.  The
`getTimezoneOffset`[](#index-getTimezoneOffset) function of a
`Date` can be used to find out how many minutes it differs from GMT
(Greenwich Mean Time).

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
now = new Date()
show now.getTimezoneOffset()
~~~~

#### *Exercise 15*

`'died 27/04/2006: Black Leclère'`

The date part is always in the exact same place of a paragraph. How
convenient. Write a function `extractDate` that takes such a paragraph
as its argument, extracts the date, and returns it as a date object.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
extractDate = (paragraph) ->
  numberAt = (start, length) ->
    Number paragraph[start...start + length]
  new Date numberAt(11, 4),     # Year
           numberAt( 8, 2) - 1, # Month
           numberAt( 5, 2)      # Day

show extractDate 'died 27-04-2006: Black Leclère'
~~~~

It would work without the calls to `Number`, but as mentioned
earlier, I prefer not to use strings as if they are numbers. The
inner function was introduced to prevent having to repeat the
`Number` and `slice` part three times.

Note the `-1` for the month number. Like most people, Aunt Emily
counts her months from 1, so we have to adjust the value before
giving it to the `Date` constructor. (The day number does not have
this problem, since `Date` objects count days in the usual human
way.)

In [Regular Expressions↓](#regular-expressions) we will see a
more practical and robust way of extracting pieces from strings
that have a fixed structure.

####

Storing cats will work differently from now on. Instead of just
putting the value `true` into the set, we store an object with
information about the cat. When a cat dies, we do not remove it
from the set, we just add a property `death` to the object to store
the date on which the creature died.

This means our `addToSet` and `removeFromSet` functions have become
useless. Something similar is needed, but it must also store
birth-dates and, later, the mother's name.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
catRecord = (name, birthdate, mother) ->
  name:   name
  birth:  birthdate
  mother: mother

addCats = (set, names, birthdate, mother) ->
  for name in names
    set[name] = catRecord name, birthdate, mother

deadCats = (set, names, deathdate) ->
  for name in names
    set[name].death = deathdate
~~~~

`catRecord` is a separate function for creating these storage
objects. It might be useful in other situations, such as creating
the object for Spot.  'Record' is a term often used for objects
like this, which are used to group a limited number of values.

##### ○•○

So let us try to extract the names of the mother cats from the
paragraphs.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
'born 15/11/2003 (mother Spot): White Fang'
~~~~

One way to do this would be…

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
extractMother = (paragraph) ->
  start = paragraph.indexOf '(mother '
  start += '(mother '.length
  end = paragraph.indexOf ')'
  paragraph[start...end]

show extractMother \
  'born 15/11/2003 (mother Spot): White Fang'
~~~~

Notice how the start position has to be adjusted for the length of
the string `'(mother '`, because `indexOf` returns the position of
the start of the pattern, not its end.

#### *Exercise 16*

The thing that `extractMother` does can be expressed in a more
general way. Write a function `between` that takes three arguments,
all of which are strings. It will return the part of the first
argument that occurs between the patterns given by the second and
the third arguments. That is:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
between 'born 15/11/2003 (mother Spot): White Fang',
        '(mother ', ')' ⇒ 'Spot'
between 'bu ] boo [ bah ] gzz', '[ ', ' ]' ⇒ 'bah'
~~~~

To make that second test work, it can be useful to know that `indexOf`
can be given a second, optional parameter that specifies at which
point it should start searching.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
between = (string, start, end) ->
  startAt = string.indexOf start
  startAt += start.length
  endAt = string.indexOf end, startAt
  string[startAt...endAt]
show between 'bu ] boo [ bah ] gzz', '[ ', ' ]'
~~~~

####

Having `between` makes it possible to express extractMother in a
simpler way:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
extractMother = (paragraph) ->
  between paragraph, '(mother ', ')'
~~~~

##### ○•○

The new, improved cat-algorithm looks like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
findCats = ->
  mailArchive = retrieveMails()
  cats = {'Spot': catRecord 'Spot',
    new Date(1997, 2, 5), 'unknown'}

  handleParagraph = (paragraph) ->
    if startsWith paragraph, 'born'
      addCats cats, catNames(paragraph),
              extractDate(paragraph),
              extractMother(paragraph)
    else if startsWith paragraph, 'died'
      deadCats cats, catNames(paragraph),
               extractDate(paragraph)

  for email in mailArchive
    paragraphs = email.split '\n'
    for paragraph in paragraphs
      handleParagraph paragraph
  cats

catData = findCats()

show catData['Clementine'], on
show catData[catData['Clementine'].mother], on
~~~~

Having that extra data allows us to finally have a clue about the
cats aunt Emily talks about. A function like this could be useful:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
formatDate = (date) -> "#{date.getDate()}/" +
                       "#{date.getMonth() + 1}/" +
                       "#{date.getFullYear()}"
catInfo = (data, name) ->
  unless name of data
    return "No cat by the name of #{name} is known."
  cat = data[name]
  message = "#{name}," +
            " born #{formatDate cat.birth}" +
            " from mother #{cat.mother}"
  if "death" of cat
    message += ", died #{formatDate cat.death}"
  "#{message}."

show catInfo catData, "Fat Igor"
~~~~

The `return` statement in `catInfo` is used as an escape hatch. If
there is no data about the given cat, the rest of the function is
meaningless, so we immediately return a value, which prevents the
rest of the code from running.

In the past, certain groups of programmers considered functions
that contain multiple `return` statements sinful. The idea was that
this made it hard to see which code was executed and which code was
not. Other techniques, which will be discussed in [Error
Handling↓](#error-handling), have made the reasons behind this
idea more or less obsolete, but you might still occasionally come
across someone who will criticise the use of 'shortcut' return
statements.

#### *Exercise 17*

The `formatDate` function used by `catInfo` does not add a zero
before the month and the day part when these are only one digit
long. Write a new version that does this.

[](#index-existential-accessor)[](#index-?.)The property 'dot'
accessor that we have been using comes in a handy form combined
with the existential operator. Instead of `object.element` we can
write `object?.element` if `object` is defined then we get the value
as before. But if it is `null` then we get `undefined` instead of
an error.

#### *Exercise 18*

Write a function `oldestCat` which, given an object containing cats
as its argument, returns the name of the oldest living cat.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
oldestCat = (data) ->
  oldest = null
  for name of data
    cat = data[name]
    unless 'death' of cat
      if oldest is null or oldest.birth > cat.birth
        oldest = cat
  oldest?.name
show oldestCat catData
~~~~

The conditions in the `unless/if` statements might seem a little
intimidating. It can be read as 'only store the current cat in the
variable `oldest` if it is not dead, and `oldest` is either `null`
or a cat that was born after the current cat'.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for cat, info of catData # Test with dead cats
  delete catData[cat] unless 'death' of info
show oldestCat catData
~~~~

Note that this function returns `undefined` when there are no living
cats in `data`. What does your solution do in that case?

####

Now that we are familiar with arrays, I can show you something
related.  Whenever a function is called, a special variable named
`arguments`[](#index-arguments) is added to the environment in
which the function body runs. This variable refers to an object
that resembles an array. It has a property `0` for the first argument,
`1` for the second, and so on for every argument the function was
given. It also has a `length`[](#index-length) property.

This object is not a real array though, it does not have methods
like `push`, and it does not automatically update its `length`
property when you add something to it. Why not, I never really found
out, but this is something one needs to be aware of.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
argumentCounter = ->
  show "You gave me #{arguments.length} arguments."

argumentCounter "Death", "Famine", "Pestilence"
~~~~

Some functions can take any number of arguments. These typically
loop over the values in the `arguments` object to do something with
them. We can create a `print` function that uses `show` to print
each of its arguments.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
print = ->
  show arg for arg in arguments
  return

print 'From here to', 1/0
~~~~

Others can take optional arguments which, when not given by the
caller, get some sensible default value.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
add = (number, howmuch) ->
  if  arguments.length < 2
    howmuch = 1
  number + howmuch

show add 6
show add 6, 4
~~~~

#### *Exercise 19*

Extend the `range` function from [Exercise 11↑](#exercise-11) to
take a second, optional argument. If only one argument is given,
it behaves as earlier and produces a range from 0 to the given
number. If two arguments are given, the first indicates the start
of the range, the second the end.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
range = (start, end) ->
  if arguments.length < 2
    end = start
    start = 0
  result = []
  for i in [start..end]
    result.push i
  result

show range 4
show range 2, 4
~~~~

The optional argument does not work precisely like the one in the
`add` example above. When it is not given, the first argument takes
the role of `end` , and `start` becomes `0`.

####

CoffeeScript has a few of features that can make it simpler to work
with arguments. You can set default values directly in the argument
list. The `show` function is defined like:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
show = (obj, shallow = off, symbol = '&rarr;') ->
  showHere currentTag, obj, shallow, symbol
  return # Suppress display of the return value
~~~~

When the arguments starting from `shallow` are not present in a call,
they get the value after the `=`. No checks are needed in the body
where the arguments are used.

For variable arguments you can use `...` commonly called splats.
The ellipsis can indicate extra arguments in a function definition
or a call. Do you remember the testPure function? It was used with
both `absolute` which takes one argument and `power` which takes
two. In its definition `(c, a...)` says that `a...` is a variable
argument list. The variable arguments are used two times, in the
call to `func` and in the call to `property`.

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
testPure = (func, types, name, property) ->
  declare name, types, (c, a...) ->
    c.assert property c, a..., c.note func a...
~~~~

Finally the `or=` operator can be used in `options or= defaults`
as shorthand for `options or (options = defaults)`.

#### *Exercise 20*

You may remember this line of code from the introduction:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
sum [1..10]
~~~~

All we need to make this line work is a `sum` function. This function
takes an array of numbers, and returns their sum. Write it, it
should be easy. Check that it also works with `range`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}

The previous chapter showed the functions `Math.max` and `Math.min`.
With what you know now, you will notice that these are really the
properties `max` and `min` of the object stored under the name
`Math`[](#index-Math). This is another role that objects can play:
A warehouse holding a number of related values.

There are quite a lot of values inside `Math`, if they would all
have been placed directly into the global environment they would,
as it is called, pollute it. The more names have been taken, the
more likely one is to accidentally overwrite the value of some
variable. For example, it is not a far shot to want to name something
`max`.

Most languages will stop you, or at least warn you, when you are
defining a variable with a name that is already taken. Not JavaScript.

In any case, one can find a whole outfit of mathematical functions
and constants inside `Math`. All the trigonometric functions are
there — `cos`, `sin`, `tan`, `acos`, `asin`, `atan`. *π* and e,
which are written with all capital letters (`PI` and `E`), which
was, at one time, a fashionable way to indicate something is a
constant. `pow` is a good replacement for the `power` functions
we have been writing, it also accepts negative and fractional
exponents.  `sqrt` takes square roots.  `max` and `min` can give
the maximum or minimum of two values.  `round`[](#index-Math.round),
`floor`[](#index-Math.floor), and `ceil`[](#index-Math.ceil) will
round numbers to the closest whole number, the whole number below
it, and the whole number above it respectively.

There are a number of other values in `Math`, but this text is an
introduction, not a reference[](#index-reference). References are
what you look at when you suspect something exists in the language,
but need to find out what it is called or how it worked exactly. A
useful [reference for predefined global
objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference#Standard_global_objects_(by_category))
like the `Math` object exist at the [Mozilla Developer
Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Javascript).

An interesting object is `Array` when you look through its
[reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
notice that many definitions for example `forEach` are marked
`Requires JavaScript 1.6` or another version number. JavaScript 1.5
corresponds to ECMA-262 3^rd^ Edition from December 1999.

More than a decade later this is still the standard that most
JavaScript engines implement — including V8, the engine that via
JavaScript compiles CoffeeScript to native machine code. It is fair
to say that JavaScript is evolving at a glacial pace. Fortunately
CoffeeScript and Underscore leapfrogs the JavaScript process and
gives you language and library advances that you can use without
waiting for existing browsers and engines to be upgraded.

##### ○•○

Maybe you already thought of a way to find out what is available
in the `Math` object:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for name of Math
  show name
~~~~

But alas, nothing appears. Similarly, when you do this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for name of ['Huey', 'Dewey', 'Loui']
  show name
~~~~

You only see `0`, `1`, and `2`, not `length`, or `push`, or `join`,
which are definitely also in there. Apparently, some properties of
objects are hidden[](#index-hidden-properties). There is a good
reason for this: All objects have a few methods, for example
`toString`[](#index-toString), which converts the object into some
kind of relevant string, and you do not want to see those when you
are, for example, looking for the cats that you stored in the object.

Why the properties of `Math` are hidden is unclear to me. Someone
probably wanted it to be a mysterious kind of object. But you can
peek under the hood in the standalone REPL; type `Math.` followed
by →∣ / 'Tab'.

All properties your programs add to objects are visible. There is
no way to make them hidden, which is unfortunate because, as we
will see in [Object Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming), it
would be nice to be able to add methods to objects without having
them show up in our `for` / `of` loops.

##### ○•○

[](#index-read-only-properties)Some properties are read-only, you
can get their value but not change it. For example, the properties
of a string value are all read-only.

[](#index-watched-properties)Other properties can be 'watched'.
Changing them causes *things* to happen. For example, lowering the
length of an array causes excess elements to be discarded:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
array = ['Heaven', 'Earth', 'Man']
array.length = 2
show array
~~~~

### Error Handling

* * * * * * * * * *


Writing programs that work when everything goes as expected is a
good start. Making your programs behave properly when encountering
unexpected conditions is where it really gets challenging.

The problematic situations that a program can encounter fall into
two categories: Programmer mistakes and genuine problems. If someone
forgets to pass a required argument to a function, that is an example
of the first kind of problem. On the other hand, if a program asks
the user to enter a name and it gets back an empty string, that is
something the programmer can not prevent.

In general, one deals with programmer errors by finding and fixing
them, and with genuine errors by having the code check for them and
perform some suitable action to remedy them (for example, asking
for the name again), or at least fail in a well-defined and clean
way.

##### ○•○

It is important to decide into which of these categories a certain
problem falls. For example, consider our old `power` function:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
power = (base, exponent) ->
  result = 1
  for count in [0...exponent]
    result *= base
  result
~~~~

When some geek tries to call `power 'Rabbit', 4`, that is quite
obviously a programmer error, but how about `power 9, 0.5`? The
function can not handle fractional exponents, but, mathematically
speaking, raising a number to the ½ power is perfectly reasonable
( `Math.pow`[](#index-Math.pow) can handle it). In situations where
it is not entirely clear what kind of input a function accepts, it
is often a good idea to explicitly state the kind of arguments that
are acceptable in a comment.

##### ○•○

If a function encounters a problem that it can not solve itself,
what should it do? In [Data
Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays) we wrote the
function `between`:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
between = (string, start, end) ->
  startAt = string.indexOf start
  startAt += start.length 
  endAt = string.indexOf end, startAt
  string[startAt...endAt]
~~~~

If the given `start` and `end` do not occur in the string, `indexOf`
will return `-1` and this version of `between` will return a lot
of nonsense:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show between 'Your mother!', '{-', '-}'
~~~~

When the program is running, and the function is called like that,
the code that called it will get a string value, as it expected,
and happily continue doing something with it. But the value is
wrong, so whatever it ends up doing with it will also be wrong. And
if you are unlucky, this wrongness only causes a problem after
having passed through twenty other functions. In cases like that,
it is extremely hard to find out where the problem started.

In some cases, you will be so unconcerned about these problems that
you do not mind the function misbehaving when given incorrect input.
For example, if you know for sure the function will only be called
from a few places, and you can prove that these places give it
decent input, it is generally not worth the trouble to make the
function bigger and uglier so that it can handle problematic cases.

But most of the time, functions that fail 'silently' are hard to
use, and even dangerous. What if the code calling `between` wants
to know whether everything went well? At the moment, it can not
tell, except by re-doing all the work that `between` did and checking
the result of `between` with its own result. That is bad. One
solution is to make `between` return a special value, such as `false`
or `undefined`, when it fails.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
between = (string, start, end) ->
  startAt = string.indexOf start
  if startAt is -1 then return
  startAt += start.length
  endAt = string.indexOf end, startAt
  if endAt is -1 then return
  string[startAt...endAt]

show between 'bu ] boo [ bah ] gzz', '[ ', ' ]'
show between 'bu [ boo bah gzz', '[ ', ' ]'
~~~~

You can see that error checking does not generally make functions
prettier. But now code that calls `between` can do something like:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
prompt "Tell me something", "", (answer) ->
  parenthesized = between answer, "(", ")"
  if parenthesized?
    show "You parenthesized '#{parenthesized}'."
~~~~

##### ○•○

In many cases returning a special value is a perfectly fine way to
indicate an error. It does, however, have its downsides. Firstly,
what if the function can already return every possible kind of
value? For example, consider this function that gets the last element
from an array:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
lastElement = (array) ->
  if array.length > 0
    array[array.length - 1]
  else
    undefined
show lastElement [1, 2, undefined]
~~~~

So did the array have a last element? Looking at the value `lastElement`
returns, it is impossible to say.

The second issue with returning special values is that it can
sometimes lead to a whole lot of clutter. If a piece of code calls
`between` ten times, it has to check ten times whether `undefined`
was returned. Also, if a function calls `between` but does not have
a strategy to recover from a failure, it will have to check the
return value of `between`, and if it is `undefined`, this function
can then return `undefined` or some other special value to its
caller, who in turn also checks for this value.

Sometimes, when something strange occurs, it would be practical to
just stop doing what we are doing and immediately jump back to a
place that knows how to handle the problem.

Well, we are in luck, a lot of programming languages provide such
a thing. Usually, it is called exception
handling[](#index-exception-handling).

##### ○•○

The theory behind exception handling goes like this: It is possible
for code to raise[](#index-raise) (or throw[](#index-throw)) an
exception[](#index-exception), which is a value. Raising an exception
somewhat resembles a super-charged return from a function — it does
not just jump out of the current function, but also out of its
callers, all the way up to the top-level call that started the
current execution.  This is called unwinding the
stack[](#index-unwinding-the-stack). You may remember the
stack[](#index-stack) of function calls that was mentioned in
[Functions↑](#functions). An exception zooms down this stack,
throwing away all the call contexts it encounters.

If they always zoomed right down to the base of the stack, exceptions
would not be of much use, they would just provide a novel way to
blow up your program. Fortunately, it is possible to set obstacles
for exceptions along the stack. These 'catch'[](#index-catch) the
exception as it is zooming down, and can do something with it, after
which the program continues running at the point where the exception
was caught.  An example:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
lastElement = (array) ->
  if array.length > 0
    array[array.length - 1]
  else
    throw 'Can not take the last element' +
          ' of an empty array.' 

lastElementPlusTen = (array) ->
  lastElement(array) + 10

try
  show lastElementPlusTen []
catch error
  show 'Something went wrong: ' + error
~~~~

`throw`[](#index-throw) is the keyword that is used to raise an
exception. The keyword `try`[](#index-try) sets up an obstacle for
exceptions: When the code in the block after it raises an exception,
the `catch`[](#index-catch) block will be executed. The variable
named in parentheses after the word `catch` is the name given to
the exception value inside this block.

Note that the function `lastElementPlusTen` completely ignores the
possibility that `lastElement` might go wrong. This is the big
advantage of exceptions — error-handling code is only necessary at
the point where the error occurs, and the point where it is handled.
The functions in between can forget all about it. Well, almost.

##### ○•○

Consider the following: A function `processThing` wants to set a
top-level variable `currentThing` to point to a specific thing while
its body executes, so that other functions can have access to that
thing too. Normally you would of course just pass the thing as an
argument, but assume for a moment that that is not practical. When
the function finishes, `currentThing` should be set back to `null`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
currentThing = null

processThing = (thing) ->
  if currentThing isnt null
    throw 'Oh no! We are already processing a thing!'

  currentThing = thing
  # do complicated processing...
  currentThing = null
~~~~

But what if the complicated processing raises an exception? In that
case the call to `processThing` will be thrown off the stack by the
exception, and `currentThing` will never be reset to `null`.  `try`
statements can also be followed by a `finally`[](#index-finally)
keyword, which means 'no matter *what* happens, run this code after
trying to run the code in the `try` block'. If a function has to
clean something up, the cleanup code should usually be put into a
`finally` block:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
processThing = (thing) ->
  if currentThing isnt null
    throw 'Oh no! We are already processing a thing!'

  currentThing = thing
  try
    # do complicated processing...
  finally
    currentThing = null
~~~~

##### ○•○

A lot of errors in programs cause the CoffeeScript environment to
raise an exception. For example:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
try
  show Sasquatch
catch error
  show 'Caught: ' + error.message
~~~~

In cases like this, special error objects are raised. These always
have a `message` property containing a description of the problem.
You can raise similar objects using the `new` keyword and the
`Error`[](#index-Error) constructor:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
try
  throw new Error 'Fire!'
catch error
  show error.toString()
~~~~

##### ○•○

When an exception goes all the way to the bottom of the stack without
being caught, it gets handled by the environment. What this means
differs between different browsers and engines, sometimes a description
of the error is written to some kind of log, sometimes a window
pops up describing the error.

The errors produced by entering code in the CoffeeScript REPL are
caught by the console, and displayed along with a stack trace.

##### ○•○

Most programmers consider exceptions purely an error-handling
mechanism.  In essence, though, they are just another way of
influencing the control flow of a program. For example, they can
be used as a kind of `break` statement in a recursive function.
Here is a slightly strange function which determines whether an
object, and the objects stored inside it, contain at least seven
`true` values:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
FoundSeven = {}
hasSevenTruths = (object) ->
  counted = 0
  count = (object) ->
    for name of object
      if object[name] is true
        if (++counted) is 7
          throw FoundSeven
      if typeof object[name] is 'object'
        count object[name]
  try
    count object
    return false
  catch exception
    if exception isnt FoundSeven
      throw exception
    return true
~~~~

The inner function `count` is recursively called for every object
that is part of the argument.  When the variable `counted` reaches
seven, there is no point in continuing to count, but just returning
from the current call to `count` will not necessarily stop the
counting, since there might be more calls below it. So what we do
is just throw a value, which will cause the control to jump right
out of any calls to `count`, and land at the `catch` block.

But just returning `true` in case of an exception is not correct.
Something else might be going wrong, so we first check whether the
exception is the object `FoundSeven`, created specifically for this
purpose. If it is not, this `catch` block does not know how to
handle it, so it raises it again.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
testdata =
  a: true
  b: true
  c: false
  d:
    a: true
    b: false
    c: true
    d:
      a: true
      b:
        a: true
    e:
      a: false
      b: true
      c: true
show hasSevenTruths testdata
~~~~

This is a pattern that is also common when dealing with error
conditions — you have to make sure that your `catch` block only
handles exceptions that it knows how to handle. Throwing string
values, as some of the examples in this chapter do, is rarely a
good idea, because it makes it hard to recognise the type of the
exception. A better idea is to use unique values, such as the
`FoundSeven` object, or to introduce a new type of objects, as
described in [Object Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming).

### Functional Programming

* * * * * * * * * *


As programs get bigger, they also become more complex and harder
to understand. We all think ourselves pretty clever, of course, but
we are mere human beings, and even a moderate amount of chaos tends
to baffle us. And then it all goes downhill. Working on something
you do not really understand is a bit like cutting random wires on
those time-activated bombs they always have in movies. If you are
lucky, you might get the right one — especially if you are the hero
of the movie and strike a suitably dramatic pose — but there is
always the possibility of blowing everything up.

Admittedly, in most cases, breaking a program does not cause any
large explosions. But when a program, by someone's ignorant tinkering,
has degenerated into a ramshackle mass of errors, reshaping it into
something sensible is a terrible labour — sometimes you might just
as well start over.

[](#index-abstraction)Thus, the programmer is always looking for
ways to keep the complexity of his programs as low as possible. An
important way to do this is to try and make code more abstract.
When writing a program, it is easy to get sidetracked into small
details at every point. You come across some little issue, and you
deal with it, and then proceed to the next little problem, and so
on. This makes the code read like a grandmother's tale.

> *Yes, dear, to make pea soup you will need split peas, the dry kind.
> And you have to soak them at least for a night, or you will have to

Another way to describe this recipe:

> *Per person: one cup dried split peas, half a chopped onion, half a
> carrot, a celery stalk, and optionally ham.*\
>  *Soak peas overnight, simmer them for two hours in four cups of water
> (per person), add vegetables and ham, and cook for ten more minutes.*

This is shorter, but if you do not know how to soak peas you will
surely screw up and put them in too little water. But how to soak
peas can be looked up, and that is the trick. If you assume a certain
basic knowledge in the audience, you can talk in a language that
deals with bigger concepts, and express things in a much shorter
and clearer way.

This, more or less, is what abstraction is.

How is this far-fetched recipe story relevant to programming? Well,
obviously, the recipe is the program. Furthermore, the basic knowledge
that the cook is supposed to have corresponds to the functions and
other constructs that are available to the programmer. If you
remember the introduction of this book, things like `while` make
it easier to build loops, and in [Data Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays)
we wrote some simple functions in order to make other functions
shorter and more straightforward. Such tools, some of them made
available by the language itself, others built by the programmer,
are used to reduce the amount of uninteresting details in the rest
of the program, and thus make that program easier to work with.

##### ○•○

Functional programming[](#index-functional-programming), which is
the subject of this chapter, produces abstraction through clever
ways of combining functions. A programmer armed with a repertoire
of fundamental functions and, more importantly, the knowledge on
how to use them, is much more effective than one who starts from
scratch. Unfortunately, a standard CoffeeScript environment comes
with deplorably few essential functions, so we have to write them
ourselves or, which is often preferable, make use of somebody else's
code (more on that in [Modularity↓](#modularity)).

In this chapter we write a set of useful functions to understand
how they work and solve problems with them to understand how to use
them. In later chapters we will use the larger set of functions in
the Underscore library that comes with CoffeeScript.

There are other popular approaches to abstraction, most notably
object-oriented programming, the subject of [Object
Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming).

##### ○•○

In programming a fundamental operation is performing an action on
every element of an array. Many programming languages have borrowed
their way of doing this from the C programming language:

~~~~ {.c}
size_t i;
size_t N = sizeof(thing) / sizeof(thing[0]);
for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
  do_something(thing[i]);
}
~~~~

That is very ugly, an eyesore if you have any good taste at all.
It has been improved somewhat in derived languages like C++ and
JavaScript.  Other programming languages can have very different
approaches[^Q].  In CoffeeScript it becomes the reasonably pleasant:

[^Q]:
    In *Mathematica* a function can be set as `Listable` — eliminating
    the need for a loop:

    ~~~ {.listing}
    f[x_] := If[x > 0, Sqrt[x], Sqrt[-x]];
    SetAttributes[f, Listable];
    f[{3, 0, -2}]

    ⇒ {√3, 0, √2}
    ~~~

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Say we have:
thing = [5..7]
doSomething = show

# then
for i in [0...thing.length] then doSomething thing[i]
# or better - you can see the generated code with: show -> \
for element in thing then doSomething element
~~~~

Still do we have to do this over and over or can it be abstracted?

The problem is that, whereas most functions just take some values,
combine them, and return something, such a loop contains a piece
of code that it must execute. It is easy to write a function that
goes over an array and prints out every element:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
printArray = (array) ->
  for element in array
    show element
  return

printArray [7..9]
~~~~

But what if we want to do something else than print? Since 'doing
something' can be represented as a function, and functions are also
values, we can pass our action as a function value:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
forEach = (array, action) ->
  for element in array
    action element
  #return

forEach ['Wampeter', 'Foma', 'Granfalloon'], show
runOnDemand -> show forEach # View generated code
~~~~

In CoffeeScript most statements are expressions that return a value,
that is also the case with the `for` statement. A `return` statement
at the end of `forEach` will make it return `undefined`. Here
`forEach` is allowed to return its value, when we get to the `map`
function you will see why.

By making use of an anonymous function, something just like a `for`
loop can be written as:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
sum = (numbers) ->
  total = 0
  forEach numbers, (number) -> total += number
  total
show sum [1, 10, 100]
~~~~

Note that the variable `total` is visible inside the anonymous
function because of the scoping rules.  Also note that this version
is hardly shorter than the `for` loop.

You do get a variable bound to the current element in the array,
`number`, so there is no need to use `numbers[i]` anymore, and when
this array is created by evaluating some expression, there is no
need to store it in a variable, because it can be passed to `forEach`
directly.

The cat-code in [Data Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays)
contains a piece like this:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
paragraphs = email.split '\n'
for paragraph in paragraphs
  handleParagraph paragraph
~~~~

This can now be written as…

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
forEach email.split('\n'), handleParagraph
~~~~

On the whole, using more abstract (or 'higher level') constructs
results in more information and less noise: The code in `sum` reads
_'for each number in numbers add that number to the total'_, instead
of… _'there is this variable that starts at zero, and it counts
upward to the length of the array called numbers, and for every
value of this variable we look up the corresponding element in the
array and add this to the total'_.

##### ○•○

What `forEach` does is take an algorithm, in this case 'going over
an array', and abstract it. The 'gaps' in the algorithm, in this
case, what to do for each of these elements, are filled by functions
which are passed to the algorithm function.

Functions that operate on other functions are called higher-order
function[](#index-higher-order-function)s. By operating on functions,
they can talk about actions on a whole new level. The `makeAddFunction`
function from [Functions↑](#functions) is also a higher-order
function. Instead of taking a function value as an argument, it
produces a new function.

Higher-order functions can be used to generalise many algorithms
that regular functions can not easily describe. When you have a
repertoire of these functions at your disposal, it can help you
think about your code in a clearer way: Instead of a messy set of
variables and loops, you can decompose algorithms into a combination
of a few fundamental algorithms, which are invoked by name, and do
not have to be typed out again and again.

Being able to write *what* we want to do instead of *how* we do it
means we are working at a higher level of abstraction. In practice,
this means shorter, clearer, and more pleasant code.

##### ○•○

Another useful type of higher-order function *modifies* the function
value it is given:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
negate = (func) ->
  (x) -> not func x

isNotNaN = negate isNaN
show isNotNaN NaN
~~~~

The function returned by `negate` feeds the argument it is given
to the original function `func`, and then negates the result. But
what if the function you want to negate takes more than one argument?
You can get access to any arguments passed to a function with the
`arguments` array, but how do you call a function when you do not
know how many arguments you have?

Functions[^R] have a method called `apply`[](#index-apply), which
is used for situations like this. It takes two arguments. The role
of the first argument will be discussed in [Object
Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming), for now we just use
`null` there. The second argument is an array containing the arguments
that the function must be applied to.

[^R]:  Unfortunately, on at least older versions of the Internet
Explorer browser a lot of built-in functions, such as `alert`, are
not *really* functions… or something. They report their type as
`'object'` when given to the `typeof` operator, and they do not
have an `apply` method. Your own functions do not suffer from this,
they are always real functions.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show Math.min.apply null, [5, 6]

negate = (func) ->
  -> not func.apply null, arguments

morethan = (x,y) -> x > y
lessthan = negate morethan
show lessthan 5, 7
~~~~

Now you know the underlying `arguments` mechanism remember that you
can also use splats…

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show Math.min [5, 6]...

negate = (func) ->
  (args...) -> not func args...

morethan = (x,y) -> x > y
lessthan = negate morethan
show lessthan 5, 7
~~~~

##### ○•○

Let us look at a few more basic algorithms related to arrays. The
`sum` function is really a variant of an algorithm which is usually
called `reduce`[](#index-reduce) or `foldl`:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
reduce = (array, combine, base) ->
  forEach array, (element) ->
    base = combine base, element
  base

add = (a, b) -> a + b
sum = (numbers) -> reduce numbers, add, 0
show sum [1, 10, 100]
~~~~

`reduce` combines an array into a single value by repeatedly using
a function that combines an element of the array with a base value.
This is exactly what `sum` did, so it can be made shorter by using
`reduce`… except that addition is an operator and not a function
in CoffeeScript, so we first had to put it into a function.

#### *Exercise 21*

Write a function `countZeroes`, which takes an array of numbers as
its argument and returns the amount of zeroes that occur in it. Use
`reduce`.

Then, write the higher-order function `count`, which takes an array
and a test function as arguments, and returns the amount of elements
in the array for which the test function returned `true`. Re-implement
`countZeroes` using this function.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
countZeroes = (array) ->
  counter = (total, element) ->
    total++ if element is 0
    total
  reduce array, counter, 0

bits = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
show countZeroes bits
~~~~

Here is the solution that uses a `count` function, with a function
that produces equality-testers included to make the final `countZeroes`
function even shorter:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
count = (test, array) ->
  reduce array, ((total, element) ->
    total + if test element then 1 else 0), 0

equals = (x) ->
  (element) -> x is element

countZeroes = (array) ->
  count equals(0), array

show countZeroes bits
~~~~

####

One other generally useful 'fundamental algorithm' related to arrays
is called `map`[](#index-map). It goes over an array, applying a
function to every element, just like `forEach`. But instead of
discarding the values returned by function, it builds up a new array
from these values.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
map = (array, func) ->
  result = []
  forEach array, (element) ->
    result.push func element
  result

show map [0.01, 2, 9.89, Math.PI], Math.round
~~~~

Note that the last argument is called `func`, not `function`, this
is because `function` is a keyword and thus not a valid variable
name. And then:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Leave out result since forEach already returns it
map = (array, func) ->
  forEach array, (element) ->
    func element

# Leave out func arguments
map = (array, func) ->
  forEach array, func

# Leave out forEach arguments
map = forEach

show map [0.01, 2, 9.89, Math.PI], Math.round
~~~~

The reduction shows how nicely functions and expressions can be
used to shorten a function. If we were concerned with the performance
of `forEach` then inserting a `return` at the end of its definition
would prevent it from collecting the results of the `for` comprehension
and we would have to provide an implementation in `map`.

There once was, living in the deep mountain forests of Transylvania,
a recluse. Most of the time, he just wandered around his mountain,
talking to trees and laughing with birds. But now and then, when
the pouring rain trapped him in his little hut, and the howling
wind made him feel unbearably small, the recluse felt an urge to
write something, wanted to pour some thoughts out onto paper, where
they could maybe grow bigger than he himself was.

After failing miserably at poetry, fiction, and philosophy, the
recluse finally decided to write a technical book. In his youth,
he had done some computer programming, and he figured that if he
could just write a good book about that, fame and recognition would
surely follow.

So he wrote. At first he used fragments of tree bark, but that
turned out not to be very practical. He went down to the nearest
village and bought himself a laptop computer. After a few chapters,
he realised he wanted to put the book in HTML format, in order to

Are you familiar with HTML? It is the method used to add mark-up
to pages on the web, and we will be using it a few times in this
book, so it would be nice if you know how it works, at least
generally. If you are a good student, you could go search the web
for a good introduction to HTML now, and come back here when you
have read it. Most of you probably are lousy students, so I will
just give a short explanation and hope it is enough.

HTML[](#index-HTML) stands for 'HyperText Mark-up Language'. An
HTML document is all text. Because it must be able to express the
structure of this text, information about which text is a heading,
which text is purple, and so on, a few characters have a special
meaning, somewhat like backslashes in CoffeeScript strings. The
'less than' and 'greater than' characters are used to create
'tag[](#index-tag)s'. A tag gives extra information about the text
in the document. It can stand on its own, for example to mark the
place where a picture should appear in the page, or it can contain
text and other tags, for example when it marks the start and end
of a paragraph.

Some tags are compulsory, a whole HTML document must always be
contained in between `html` tags. The HTML version is specified on
the first line with the document type, `DOCTYPE`, so browsers can
parse and render it correctly. Here is an example of an HTML~5~
document:

~~~~ {.html}
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <title>A quote</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A quote</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The connection between the language in which we
      think/program and the problems and solutions we can
      imagine is very close. For this reason restricting
      language features with the intent of eliminating
      programmer errors is at best dangerous.</p>
      <p>-- Bjarne Stroustrup</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Stroustrup is the inventor of the C++
    programming language, but quite an insightful
    person nevertheless.</p>
    <p>Also, here is a picture of an ostrich:</p>
    <img src="../img/ostrich.jpg"/>
  </body>
</html>
~~~~

Elements that contain text or other tags are first opened with
`<tagname>`, and afterwards finished with `</tagname>`. The `html`
element always contains two children: `head` and `body`. The first
contains information *about* the document, the second contains the
actual document.

Most tag names are cryptic abbreviations.  `h1` stands for 'heading
1', the biggest kind of heading. There are also `h2` to `h6` for
successively smaller headings.  `p` means 'paragraph', and `img`
stands for 'image'. The `img` element does not contain any text or
other tags, but it does have some extra information,
`src="../img/ostrich.png"`, which is called an
'attribute'[](#index-attribute). In this case, it contains information
about the image file that should be shown here.

Because `<` and `>` have a special meaning in HTML documents, they
can not be written directly in the text of the document. If you
want to say '`5 < 10`' in an HTML document, you have to write '`5
&lt; 10`', where '`lt`' stands for 'less than'. '`&gt;`' is used
for '`>`', and because these codes also give the ampersand character
a special meaning, a plain '`&`' is written as '`&amp;`'.

Now, those are only the bare basics of HTML, but they should be
enough to make it through this chapter, and later chapters that
deal with HTML documents, without getting entirely confused.

The interactive environment has a function `showDocument` that can
be used to look at HTML documents. If you have a webpage in a string
variable then you can display it with: `showDocument variableName,
width, height`. You can also give it a document in a string
directly.[^5]

    In the standalone environment, the prelude has a function
    `viewURL` that can be used to look at HTML documents. The example
    document above is stored in the file `'06-Quote.html'`, so you
    can view it by executing the following code:

    ~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
    viewURL '06-Quote.html'
    ~~~~

    You can also run a tiny server from your program or the interactive
    CoffeeScript environment (REPL). It can serve a webpage either
    from a string variable or from a file. If you have created a
    web page in a string variable, say `stroustrupQuote` then you
    can start the server with:

    ~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
    viewServer stroustrupQuote
    ~~~~

    Or you could give it a filename as its argument. When you are
    done with the server then you can either type `stopServer()`
    or `CTRL-C`.

So, picking up the story again, the recluse wanted to have his book
in HTML format. At first he just wrote all the tags directly into
his manuscript, but typing all those less-than and greater-than
signs made his fingers hurt, and he constantly forgot to write
`&amp;` when he needed an `&`. This gave him a headache. Next, he
tried to write the book in Microsoft Word, and then save it as HTML.
But the HTML that came out of that was fifteen times bigger and
more complicated than it had to be.  And besides, Microsoft Word
gave him a headache.

The solution that he eventually came up with was this: He would
write the book as plain text, following some simple rules about the
way paragraphs were separated and the way headings looked. Then,
he would write a program to convert this text into precisely the
HTML that he wanted.

The rules are this:

1.  Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.
2.  A paragraph that starts with a '%' symbol is a header. The
    more '%' symbols, the smaller the header.
3.  Inside paragraphs, pieces of text can be emphasised by
    putting them between asterisks.
4.  Footnotes are written between braces.

##### ○•○

After he had struggled painfully with his book for six months, the
recluse had still only finished a few paragraphs. At this point,
his hut was struck by lightning, killing him, and forever putting
his writing ambitions to rest. From the charred remains of his
laptop, I could recover the following manuscript, that I have placed
in a global string variable, `recluseFile`, so you can get it as a
string value in the following.

% The Book of Programming

%% The Two Aspects

Below the surface of the machine, the program moves.
Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, 
electrons scatter and regroup. The forms on the monitor
are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly
below.

When the creators built the machine, they put in the
processor and the memory. From these arise the two aspects
of the program.

The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is
called Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive 
substance. It is called Data.

Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms.
Control consists only of simple instructions, yet it
performs difficult tasks. From the small and trivial, the
large and complex arise.

The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The
Control proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from
the other, the other is useless without the one. This is
the harmonious cycle of Data and Control.

Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The
programmers of old moulded their programs out of this raw
substance. Over time, the amorphous Data has crystallised
into data types, and the chaotic Control was restricted
into control structures and functions.

%% Short Sayings

When a student asked Fu-Tzu about the nature of the cycle
of Data and Control, Fu-Tzu replied 'Think of a compiler,
compiling itself.'

A student asked 'The programmers of old used only simple
machines and no programming languages, yet they made
beautiful programs. Why do we use complicated machines
and programming languages?'. Fu-Tzu replied 'The builders
of old used only sticks and clay, yet they made beautiful
huts.'

A hermit spent ten years writing a program. 'My program can
compute the motion of the stars on a 286-computer running
MS DOS', he proudly announced. 'Nobody owns a 286-computer
or uses MS DOS anymore.', Fu-Tzu responded.

Fu-Tzu had written a small program that was full of global
state and dubious shortcuts. Reading it, a student asked
'You warned us against these techniques, yet I find them in
your program. How can this be?' Fu-Tzu said 'There is no
need to fetch a water hose when the house is not on fire.'
{This is not to be read as an encouragement of sloppy
programming, but rather as a warning against neurotic
adherence to rules of thumb.}

%% Wisdom

A student was complaining about digital numbers. 'When I
take the root of two and then square it again, the result
is already inaccurate!'. Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed.
'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down the precise value of
the square root of two for me.'

Fu-Tzu said 'When you cut against the grain of the wood,
much strength is needed. When you program against the grain
of a problem, much code is needed.'

Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their
latest programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li,
'not counting comments!'. 'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, 'mine is
almost a *million* lines already.' Fu-Tzu said 'My best
program has five hundred lines.' Hearing this, Tzu-li and
Tzu-ssu were enlightened.

A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer
for hours, frowning darkly. He was trying to write a
beautiful solution to a difficult problem, but could not
find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit him on the back of his
head and shouted '*Type something!*' The student started
writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he
suddenly understood the beautiful solution.

%% Progression

A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant
builds her hill, one piece at a time, without thought for
the bigger structure. His programs will be like loose sand.
They may stand for a while, but growing too big they fall
apart{Referring to the danger of internal inconsistency
and duplicated structure in unorganised code.}.

Realising this problem, the programmer will start to spend
a lot of time thinking about structure. His programs will
be rigidly structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid,
but when they must change, violence must be done to them
{Referring to the fact that structure tends to put
restrictions on the evolution of a program.}.

The master programmer knows when to apply structure and
when to leave things in their simple form. His programs
are like clay, solid yet malleable.

%% Language

When a programming language is created, it is given
syntax and semantics. The syntax describes the form of
the program, the semantics describe the function. When the
syntax is beautiful and the semantics are clear, the
program will be like a stately tree. When the syntax is
clumsy and the semantics confusing, the program will be
like a bramble bush.

Tzu-ssu was asked to write a program in the language
called  Java, which takes a very primitive approach to
functions. Every morning, as he sat down in front of his
computer, he started complaining. All day he cursed,
blaming the language for all that went wrong. Fu-Tzu
listened for a while, and then reproached him, saying
'Every language has its own way. Follow its form, do not
try to program as if you were using another language.'

##### ○•○

To honour the memory of our good recluse, I would like to finish
his HTML-generating program for him. A good approach to this problem
goes like this:

1.  Split the file into paragraphs by cutting it at every empty line.
2.  Remove the '%' characters from header paragraphs and mark them as
    headers.
3.  Process the text of the paragraphs themselves, splitting them into
    normal parts, emphasised parts, and footnotes.
4.  Move all the footnotes to the bottom of the document, leaving
    numbers[^S] in their place.
5.  Wrap each piece into the correct HTML tags.
6.  Combine everything into a single HTML document.

[^S]:  Like this…

This approach does not allow footnotes inside emphasised text, or
vice versa. This is kind of arbitrary, but helps keep the example
code simple. If, at the end of the chapter, you feel like an extra
challenge, you can try to revise the program to support 'nested'
mark-up.

##### ○•○

Step 1 of the algorithm is trivial. A blank line is what you get
when you have two newlines in a row, and if you remember the `split`
method that strings have, which we saw in [Data
Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays), you will realise
that this will do the trick:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
paragraphs = recluseFile.split "\n\n"
show "Found #{paragraphs.length} paragraphs."
~~~~

#### *Exercise 22*

Write a function `processParagraph` that, when given a paragraph
string as its argument, checks whether this paragraph is a header.
If it is, it strips of the '%' characters and counts their number.
Then, it returns an object with two properties, `content`, which
contains the text inside the paragraph, and `type`, which contains
the tag that this paragraph must be wrapped in, `'p'` for regular
paragraphs, `'h1'` for headers with one '%', and `'hX'` for headers
with `X` '%' characters.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
processParagraph = (paragraph) ->
  header = 0
  while paragraph[0] is '%'
    paragraph = paragraph.slice 1
    header++
  type: if header is 0 then 'p' else 'h' + header,
  content: paragraph

show processParagraph paragraphs[0]
~~~~

####

This is where we can try out the `map` function we saw earlier.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
paragraphs = map recluseFile.split('\n\n'),
                 processParagraph
show paragraph for paragraph in paragraphs[0..2]
~~~~

And *bang*, we have an array of nicely categorised paragraph objects.
We are getting ahead of ourselves though, we forgot step 3 of the
algorithm:

> *Process the text of the paragraphs themselves, splitting them into
> normal parts, emphasised parts, and footnotes.*

Which can be decomposed into:

1.  If the paragraph starts with an asterisk, take off the emphasised
    part and store it.
2.  If the paragraph starts with an opening brace, take off the footnote
    and store it.
3.  Otherwise, take off the part until the first emphasised part or
    footnote, or until the end of the string, and store it as normal
    text.
4.  If there is anything left in the paragraph, start at 1 again.

#### *Exercise 23*

Build a function `splitParagraph` which, given a paragraph string,
returns an array of paragraph fragments. Think of a good way to
represent the fragments, they need `type` and `content` properties.

The method `indexOf`, which searches for a character or sub-string
in a string and returns its position, or `-1` if not found, will
probably be useful in some way here.

This is a tricky algorithm, and there are many not-quite-correct
or way-too-long ways to describe it. If you run into problems, just
think about it for a minute. Try to write inner functions that
perform the smaller actions that make up the algorithm.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

Here is one possible solution:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
splitParagraph = (text) ->
  # Find character position or end of text
  indexOrEnd = (character) ->
    index = text.indexOf character
    if index is -1 then text.length else index

  # Return and remove text upto next special
  # character or end of text
  takeNormal = ->
    end = reduce map(['*', '{'], indexOrEnd),
                 Math.min, text.length
    part = text.slice 0, end
    text = text.slice end
    part

  # Return and remove text upto character
  takeUpTo = (character) ->
    end = text.indexOf character, 1
    if end is -1
      throw new Error 'Missing closing ' +
                      '"' + character + '"'
    part = text.slice 1, end
    text = text.slice end + 1
    part

  fragments = [];

  while text isnt ''
    if text[0] is '*'
      fragments.push
        type: 'emphasised',
        content: takeUpTo '*'
    else if text[0] is '{'
      fragments.push
        type: 'footnote',
        content: takeUpTo '}'
    else
      fragments.push
        type: 'normal',
        content: takeNormal()
  fragments
~~~~

Note the over-eager use of `map` and `reduce` in the `takeNormal`
function. This is a chapter about functional programming, so program
functionally we will! Can you see how this works? The `map` produces
an array of positions where the given characters were found, or the
end of the string if they were not found, and the `reduce` takes
the minimum of them, which is the next point in the string that we
have to look at.

If you'd write that out without mapping and reducing you'd get
something like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
takeNormalAlternative = ->
  nextAsterisk = text.indexOf '*'
  nextBrace = text.indexOf '{'
  end = text.length
  if nextAsterisk isnt -1
    end = nextAsterisk
  if nextBrace isnt -1 and nextBrace < end
    end = nextBrace
  part = text.slice 0, end
  text = text.slice end
  part
~~~~

Which is even more hideous. Most of the time, when a decision has
to be made based on a series of things, even if there are only two
of them, writing it as array operations is nicer than handling every
value in a separate `if` statement. (Fortunately, [Regular
Expressions↓](#regular-expressions) describes an easier way
to ask for the first occurrence of 'this or that character' in a
string.)

If you wrote a `splitParagraph` that stored fragments in a different
way than the solution above, you might want to adjust it, because
the functions in the rest of the chapter assume that fragments are
objects with `type` and `content` properties.

####

We can now wire `processParagraph` to also split the text inside
the paragraphs, my version can be modified like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
processParagraph = (paragraph) ->
  header = 0
  while paragraph[0] is '%'
    paragraph = paragraph.slice 1
    header++
  type: if header is 0 then 'p' else 'h' + header,
  content: splitParagraph paragraph

# Adhoc test
paragraphs = map recluseFile.split('\n\n'),
                 processParagraph
show paragraph for paragraph in paragraphs[0..2]
~~~~

Mapping that over the array of paragraphs gives us an array of
paragraph objects, which in turn contain arrays of fragment objects.
The next thing to do is to take out the footnotes, and put references
to them in their place. Something like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
extractFootnotes = (paragraphs) ->
  footnotes = []
  currentNote = 0
  replaceFootnote = (fragment) ->
    if fragment.type is 'footnote'
      ++currentNote
      footnotes.push fragment
      fragment.number = currentNote
      type: 'reference', number: currentNote
    else
      fragment

  forEach paragraphs, (paragraph) ->
    paragraph.content = map paragraph.content,
                            replaceFootnote
  footnotes

show 'Footnotes from the recluse:'
show extractFootnotes paragraphs
show paragraphs[20]
~~~~

The `replaceFootnote` function is called on every fragment. When
it gets a fragment that should stay where it is, it just returns
it, but when it gets a footnote, it stores this footnote in the
`footnotes` array, and returns a reference to it instead. In the
process, every footnote and reference is also numbered.

##### ○•○

That gives us enough tools to extract the information we need from
the file. All that is left now is generating the correct HTML.

A lot of people think that concatenating strings is a great way to
produce HTML. When they need a link to, for example, a site where
you can play the game of Go, they will do:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
url = "http://www.gokgs.com/"
text = "Play Go!"
linkText = "<a href=\"#{url}\">#{text}</a>"
show _.escape linkText
# Without the _.escape it becomes a link
show linkText
~~~~

(Where `a` is the tag used to create links in HTML documents.) …
Not only is this clumsy, but when the string `text` happens to
include an angular bracket or an ampersand, it is also wrong.  Weird
things will happen on your website, and you will look embarrassingly
amateurish. We would not want that to happen. A few simple
HTML-generating functions are easy to write. So let us write them.

##### ○•○

The secret to successful HTML generation is to treat your HTML
document as a data structure instead of a flat piece of text.
CoffeeScript's objects provide a very easy way to model this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
linkObject =
  name: 'a'
  attributes:
    href: 'http://www.gokgs.com/'
  content: ['Play Go!']
~~~~

Each HTML element contains a `name` property, giving the name of
the tag it represents. When it has attributes, it also contains an
`attributes` property, which contains an object in which the
attributes are stored.  When it has content, there is a `content`
property, containing an array of other elements contained in this
element. Strings play the role of pieces of text in our HTML document,
so the array `['Play Go!']` means that this link has only one element
inside it, which is a simple piece of text.

Typing in these objects directly is clumsy, but we do not have to
do that. We provide a shortcut function to do this for us:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
tag = (name, content, attributes) ->
  name: name
  attributes: attributes
  content: content
~~~~

Note that, since we allow the `attributes` and `content` of an
element to be undefined if they are not applicable, the second and
third argument to this function can be left off when they are not
needed.  `tag` is still rather primitive, so we write shortcuts for
common types of elements, such as links, or the outer structure of
a simple document:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
link = (target, text) ->
  tag "a", [text], href: target

show link "http://www.gokgs.com/", "Play Go!"

htmlDoc = (title, bodyContent) ->
  tag "html", [tag("head", [tag "title", [title]]),
               tag "body", bodyContent]

show htmlDoc "Quote", "In his house at R'lyeh " +
                      "dead Cthulu waits dreaming."
~~~~

#### *Exercise 24*

Looking back at the example HTML document if necessary, write an
`image` function which, when given the location of an image file,
will create an `img` HTML element.

When we have created a document, it will have to be reduced to a
string.  But building this string from the data structures we have
been producing is very straightforward. The important thing is to
remember to transform the special characters in the text of our
document…

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
escapeHTML = (text) ->
  replacements = [[/&/g, '&amp;']
                  [/"/g, '&quot;']
                  [/</g, '&lt;']
                  [/>/g, '&gt;']]
  forEach replacements, (replace) ->
    text = text?.replace replace[0], replace[1]
  text

show escapeHTML '< " & " >'
~~~~

The `replace` method of strings creates a new string in which all
occurrences of the pattern in the first argument are replaced by
the second argument, so `'Borobudur'.replace(/r/g, 'k')` gives
`'Bokobuduk'`. Do not worry about the pattern syntax here — we will
get to that in [Regular Expressions↓](#regular-expressions).
The `escapeHTML` function puts the different replacements that have
to be made into an array, so that it can loop over them and apply
them to the argument one by one.

Double quotes are also replaced, because we will also be using this
function for the text inside the attributes of HTML tags. Those
will be surrounded by double quotes, and thus must not have any
double quotes inside of them.

Calling replace four times means the computer has to go over the
whole string four times to check and replace its content. This is
not very efficient. If we cared enough, we could write a more complex
version of this function, something that resembles the `splitParagraph`
function we saw earlier, to go over it only once. For now, we are
too lazy for this. Again, [Regular Expressions↓](#regular-expressions)
shows a much better way to do this.

##### ○•○

To turn an HTML element object into a string, we can use a recursive
function like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
renderHTML = (element) ->
  pieces = []

  renderAttributes = (attributes) ->
    result = []
    if attributes
      for name of attributes 
        result.push ' ' + name + '="' +
          escapeHTML(attributes[name]) + '"'
    result.join ''

  render = (element) ->
    # Text node
    if typeof element is 'string'
      pieces.push escapeHTML element
    # Empty tag
    else if not element.content or
                element.content.length is 0
      pieces.push '<' + element.name +
        renderAttributes(element.attributes) + '/>'
    # Tag with content
    else
      pieces.push '<' + element.name +
        renderAttributes(element.attributes) + '>'
      forEach element.content, render
      pieces.push '</' + element.name + '>'

  render element
  pieces.join ''

Note the `of` loop that extracts the properties from a CoffeeScript
object in order to make HTML tag attributes out of them. Also note
that in two places, arrays are being used to accumulate strings,
which are then joined into a single result string. Why did I not
just start with an empty string and then add the content to it with
the `+=` operator?

It turns out that creating new strings, especially big strings, is
quite a lot of work. Remember that CoffeeScript string values never
change. If you concatenate something to them, a new string is
created, the old ones stay intact. If we build up a big string by
concatenating lots of little strings, new strings have to be created
at every step, only to be thrown away when the next piece is
concatenated to them. If, on the other hand, we store all the little
strings in an array and then join them, only *one* big string has
to be created.

So, let us try out this HTML generating system…

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show renderHTML link 'http://www.nedroid.com', 'Drawings!'
~~~~

That seems to work.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
body = [tag('h1', ['The Test']),
        tag('p', ['Here is a paragraph ' +
                  'and an image...']),
        image(ostrich)]
doc = htmlDoc 'The Test', body
show renderHTML doc
~~~~

Now, I should probably warn you that this approach is not perfect.
What it actually renders is XML[](#index-XML), which is similar
to HTML, but more structured. In simple cases, such as the above,
this does not cause any problems. However, there are some things,
which are correct XML, but not proper HTML, and these might confuse
a browser that is trying to show the documents we create. For
example, if you have an empty `script` tag (used to put JavaScript
into a page) in your document, browsers will not realise that it
is empty and think that everything after it is JavaScript. (In this
case, the problem can be fixed by putting a single space inside of
the tag, so that it is no longer empty, and gets a proper closing
tag.)

#### *Exercise 25*

Write a function `renderFragment`, and use that to implement another
function `renderParagraph`, which takes a paragraph object (with
the footnotes already filtered out), and produces the correct HTML
element (which might be a paragraph or a header, depending on the
`type` property of the paragraph object).

This function might come in useful for rendering the footnote
references:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
footnote = (number) ->
  tag 'sup',
    [link '#footnote' + number, String number]

show footnote(42), 3
~~~~


A `sup` tag will show its content as 'superscript', which means it
will be smaller and a little higher than other text. The target of
the link will be something like `'#footnote1'`. Links that contain
a '#' character refer to 'anchors' within a page, and in this case
we will use them to make it so that clicking on the footnote link
will take the reader to the bottom of the page, where the footnotes
live.

The tag to render emphasised fragments with is `em`, and normal
text can be rendered without any extra tags.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
renderFragment = (fragment) ->
  if fragment.type is 'reference'
    footnote fragment.number
  else if fragment.type is 'emphasised'
    tag 'em', [fragment.content]
  else if fragment.type is 'normal'
    fragment.content

renderParagraph = (paragraph) ->
  tag paragraph.type,
    map paragraph.content, renderFragment

show renderParagraph paragraphs[7]
~~~~

####

We are almost finished. The only thing that we do not have a rendering
function for yet are the footnotes. To make the `'#footnote1'` links
work, an anchor must be included with every footnote. In HTML, an
anchor is specified with an `a` element, which is also used for
links. In this case, it needs a `name` attribute, instead of an
`href`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
renderFootnote = (footnote) ->
  anchor = tag "a", [],
    name: "footnote" + footnote.number
  number = "[#{footnote.number}] "
  tag "p", [tag("small",
    [anchor, number, footnote.content])]
~~~~

Here, then, is the function which, when given a file in the correct
format and a document title, returns an HTML document:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
renderFile = (file, title) ->
  paragraphs = map file.split('\n\n'),
                   processParagraph
  footnotes = map extractFootnotes(paragraphs),
                  renderFootnote
  body = map paragraphs,
             renderParagraph
  body = body.concat footnotes
  renderHTML htmlDoc title, body

runOnDemand ->
  page = renderFile recluseFile, 'The Book of Programming'
  showDocument page, 565, 500
~~~~

The `concat`[](#index-concat) method of an array can be used to
concatenate another array to it, similar to what the `+` operator
does with strings.

##### ○•○

In the chapters after this one, elementary higher-order functions
like `map` and `reduce` will always be available from the Underscore
library and will be used by code examples. Now and then, a new
useful tool is explained and added to this. In
[Modularity↓](#modularity), we develop a more structured
approach to this set of 'basic' functions.

##### ○•○

In some functional programming languages operators are functions,
for example in Pure you can write `foldl (+) 0 (1..10);` the same
in CoffeeScript is `reduce [1..10], ((a, b) -> a + b), 0`. A way
to shorten this is by defining an object that is indexed by an
operator in a string:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
op = {
       '+':   (a, b) -> a + b
       '==':  (a, b) -> a == b
       '!':   (a)    -> !a
       # and so on
     }
show reduce [1..10], op['+'], 0
~~~~

The list of operators is quite long, so it is questionable whether
such a data structure improves readability compared to:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
add = (a, b) -> a + b
show reduce [1..10], add, 0
~~~~

And what if we need something like `equals` or `makeAddFunction`,
in which one of the arguments already has a value? In that case we
are back to writing a new function again.

For cases like that, something called 'partial
application'[](#index-partial-application) is useful. You want to
create a new function that already knows some of its arguments, and
treats any additional arguments it is passed as coming after these
fixed arguments. A simple version[^partial] of this could be:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
partial = (func, a...) ->
  (b...) -> func a..., b...

f = (a,b,c,d) -> show "#{a} #{b} #{c} #{d}"
g = partial f, 1, 2
g 3, 4
~~~~

[^partial]: An [extended
version](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/literate/partial.html)
can allow arbitrary arguments to be fixed.

The return value of `partial` is a function where the `a...` arguments
have been applied. When the returned function is called the `b...`
arguments are appended to the arguments of `func`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
equals10 = partial op['=='], 10
show map [1, 10, 100], equals10
~~~~

Unlike traditional functional definitions, Underscore defines the
order of its arguments as array before action. That means we can
not simply say:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
square = (x) -> x * x
try
  show map [[10, 100], [12, 16], [0, 1]],
           partial map, square # Incorrect
catch error
  show "Error: #{error.message}"
~~~~

Since the square function needs to be the second argument of the
inner map. But we can define another partial function that reverses
its arguments:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
partialReverse = (func, a) -> (b) -> func b, a

mapSquared = partialReverse map, square
show map [[10, 100], [12, 16], [0, 1]], mapSquared
~~~~

However it is again worthwhile to consider whether the intent of
the program is clearer when the functions are defined directly:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show map [[10, 100], [12, 16], [0, 1]],
  (sublist) -> map sublist, (x) -> x * x
~~~~

##### ○•○

A trick that can be useful when you want to combine functions is
function composition[](#index-function-composition). At the start
of this chapter I showed a function `negate`, which applies the
boolean *not* operator to the result of calling a function:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
negate = (func) ->
  (args...) -> not func args...
~~~~

This is a special case of a general pattern: call function A, and
then apply function B to the result. Composition is a common concept
in mathematics. [](#index-compose)It can be caught in a higher-order
function like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
compose = (func1, func2) ->
  (args...) -> func1 func2 args...

isUndefined = (value) -> value is undefined
isDefined = compose ((v) -> not v), isUndefined
show 'isDefined Math.PI  = ' + isDefined Math.PI
show 'isDefined Math.PIE = ' + isDefined Math.PIE
~~~~

In `isDefined` we are defining a new function without naming it.
This can be useful when you need to create a simple function to
give to, for example, `map` or `reduce`. However, when a function
becomes more complex than this example, it is usually shorter and
clearer to define it by itself and name it.

### Searching

* * * * * * * * * *


This chapter introduces new functional programming concepts and
their use in problem solving. We will go through the solution of
two problems, discussing some interesting algorithms and techniques
along the way.

The Underscore library is used to make it pleasant to work with the
functional abstractions. Its functions are not directly available,
they need to be written with a `_.` in front of them.  See the
[interactive Underscore
reference](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/literate/underscore.html)
for details and examples on all the functions.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# List functions in Underscore
runOnDemand -> show _.functions _
~~~~

The functions in Underscore could be made available as global
functions, then they would be more convenient to use. This was done
in the static editions of this book and works fine in isolated
environments. However as is explained in [Modularity↓](#modularity)
many global functions can lead to interference between them. So in
this edition Underscore has to be qualified in the same way as when
you use it to build reusable libraries or when you work in a shared
project.

##### ○•○

Let me introduce our first problem. Take a look at this map. It
shows Hiva Oa, a small tropical island in the Pacific Ocean.

![figure ../img/Hiva Oa-small.png](../img/Hiva%20Oa-small.png)\


The black lines are roads, and the numbers next to them are the
lengths of these roads. Imagine we need a program that finds the
shortest route between two points on Hiva Oa. How could we approach
that? Think about this for a moment.

No really. Do not just steamroll on to the next paragraph. Try to
seriously think of some ways you could do this, and consider the
issues you would come up against. When reading a technical book,
it is way too easy to just zoom over the text, nod solemnly, and
promptly forget what you have read. If you make a sincere effort
to solve a problem, it becomes *your* problem, and its solution
will be more meaningful.

##### ○•○

The first aspect of this problem is, again, representing our data.
The information in the picture does not mean much to our computer.
We could try writing a program that looks at the map and extracts
the information in it… but that can get complicated. If we had
twenty-thousand maps to interpret, this would be a good idea, in
this case we will do the interpretation ourself and transcribe the
map into a more computer-friendly format.

What does our program need to know? It has to be able to look up
which locations are connected, and how long the roads between them
are. The places and roads on the island form a graph[](#index-graph),
as mathematicians call it. There are many ways to store graphs. A
simple possibility is to just store an array of road objects, each
of which contains properties naming its two endpoints and its length…

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show roads = [
  { point1: 'Point Kiukiu', point2: 'Hanaiapa', length: 19 }
  { point1: 'Point Kiukiu', point2: 'Mt Feani', length: 15 }
] # and so on
~~~~

However, it turns out that the program, as it is working out a
route, will very often need to get a list of all the roads that
start at a certain location, like a person standing on a crossroads
will look at a signpost and read “Hanaiapa: 19km, Mount Feani:
15km”. It would be nice if this was easy (and quick) to do.

With the representation given above, we have to sift through the
whole list of roads, picking out the relevant ones, every time we
want this signpost list. A better approach would be to store this
list directly.  For example, use an object that associates place-names
with signpost lists:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show roads =
  'Point Kiukiu': [ {to: 'Hanaiapa', distance: 19}
                    {to: 'Mt Feani', distance: 15}
                    {to: 'Taaoa', distance: 15} ]
  'Taaoa':        [ ] # et cetera
~~~~

When we have this object, getting the roads that leave from Point
Kiukiu is just a matter of looking at `roads['Point Kiukiu']`.

##### ○•○

However, this new representation does contain duplicate information:
The road between A and B is listed both under A and under B. The
first representation was already a lot of work to type in, this one
is even worse.

Fortunately, we have at our command the computer's talent for
repetitive work. We can specify the roads once, and have the correct
data structure be generated by the computer. First, initialise an
empty object called `roads`, and write a function `makeRoad`:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
@roads = {}
makeRoad = (from, to, length) ->
  addRoad = (from, to) ->
    roads[from] = [] if not (from of roads)
    roads[from].push to: to, distance: length
  addRoad from, to
  addRoad to, from
~~~~

Nice, huh? Notice how the inner function, `addRoad`, uses the same
names (`from`, `to`) for its parameters as the outer function. These
will not interfere: inside `addRoad` they refer to `addRoad`'s
parameters, and outside it they refer to `makeRoad`'s parameters.

The `if` statement in `addRoad` makes sure that there is an array
of destinations associated with the location named by `from`, if
there is not one it puts in an empty array. This way, the next line
can assume there is such an array and safely push the new road onto
it.

Now the map information looks like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
makeRoad 'Point Kiukiu', 'Hanaiapa', 19
makeRoad 'Point Kiukiu', 'Mt Feani', 15
makeRoad 'Point Kiukiu', 'Taaoa', 15
show roads
~~~~

#### *Exercise 26*

In the above description, the string `'Point Kiukiu'` still occurs
three times in a row. We could make our description even more
succinct by allowing multiple roads to be specified in one line.

Write a function `makeRoads` that takes any uneven number of
arguments. The first argument is always the starting point of the
roads, and every pair of arguments after that gives an ending point
and a distance.

Do not duplicate the functionality of `makeRoad`, but have `makeRoads`
call `makeRoad` to do the actual road-making.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
makeRoads = (start) ->
  for i in [1...arguments.length] by 2
    makeRoad start, arguments[i], arguments[i + 1]
~~~~

This function uses one named parameter, `start`, and gets the other
parameters from the `arguments` (quasi-) array. `i` starts at `1`
because it has to skip this first parameter. `by 2` skips the
distances.

####

You can verify the solution with this code that builds a data
structure matching the map of Hiva Oa.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
@roads = {}
makeRoads 'Point Kiukiu',
  'Hanaiapa', 19, 'Mt Feani', 15, 'Taaoa', 15
makeRoads 'Airport',
  'Hanaiapa', 6, 'Mt Feani', 5,
  'Atuona', 4, 'Mt Ootua', 11
makeRoads 'Mt Temetiu',
  'Mt Feani', 8, 'Taaoa', 4
makeRoads 'Atuona',
  'Taaoa', 3, 'Hanakee pearl lodge', 1
makeRoads 'Cemetery',
  'Hanakee pearl lodge', 6, 'Mt Ootua', 5
makeRoads 'Hanapaoa',
  'Mt Ootua', 3
makeRoads 'Puamua',
  'Mt Ootua', 13, 'Point Teohotepapapa', 14
show 'Roads from the Airport:'
show roads['Airport']
~~~~

We managed to considerably shorten our description of the road
information by defining some convenient operations. You could say
we expressed the information more succinctly by expanding our
vocabulary.  [](#index-domain-specific-language)Defining a 'little
language' like this is often a very powerful technique — when, at
any time, you find yourself writing repetitive or redundant code,
stop and try to come up with a vocabulary that makes it shorter and
denser.

Redundant code is not only a bore to write, it is also error-prone,
people pay less attention when doing something that does not require
them to think. On top of that, repetitive code is hard to change,
because structure that is repeated a hundred times has to be changed
a hundred times when it turns out to be incorrect or suboptimal.

##### ○•○

If you ran all the pieces of code above, you should now have a
variable named `roads` that contains all the roads on the island.
When we need the roads starting from a certain place, we could just
do `roads[place]`. But then, when someone makes a typo in a place
name, which is not unlikely with these names, he will get `undefined`
instead of the array he expects, and strange errors will follow.
Instead, we will use a function that retrieves the road arrays, and
yells at us when we give it an unknown place name:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
roadsFrom = (place) ->
  found = roads[place]
  return found if found?
  throw new Error "No place named '#{place}' found."
    
try
  show roadsFrom "Hanaiapa"
  show roadsFrom "Hanalapa"
catch error
  show "Oops #{error}"
~~~~

##### ○•○

Here is a first stab at a path-finding algorithm, the gambler's
method:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
gamblerPath = (from, to) ->

  randomInteger = (below) ->
    Math.floor Math.random() * below

  randomDirection = (from) ->
    options = roadsFrom from
    options[randomInteger(options.length)].to

  path = []
  loop
    path.push from
    break if from is to
    from = randomDirection from
  path

show gamblerPath 'Hanaiapa', 'Mt Feani'
~~~~

At every split in the road, the gambler rolls his dice to decide
which road he shall take. If the dice sends him back the way he
came, so be it. Sooner or later, he will arrive at his destination,
since all places on the island are connected by roads.

The most confusing line is probably the one containing
`Math.random`[](#index-Math.random). This function returns a
pseudo-random[^T] number between 0 and 1. Try calling it a few times
from the console, it will (most likely) give you a different number
every time.  The function `randomInteger` multiplies this number
by the argument it is given, and rounds the result down with
`Math.floor`. Thus, for example, `randomInteger 3` will produce the
number `0`, `1`, or `2`.

[^T]: Computers are deterministic machines: They always react in
the same way to the input they receive, so they can not produce
truly random values.  Therefore, we have to make do with series of
numbers that look random, but are in fact the result of some
complicated deterministic computation.

##### ○•○

The gambler's method is the way to go for those who abhor structure and
planning, who desperately search for adventure. We set out to write a
program that could find the *shortest* route between places though, so
something else will be needed.

A very straightforward approach to solving such a problem is called
'generate and test'[](#index-generate-and-test). It goes like this:

1.  Generate all possible routes.
2.  In this set, find the shortest one that actually connects the start
    point to the end point.

Step two is not hard. Step one is a little problematic. If you allow
routes with circles in them, there is an infinite amount of routes.
Of course, routes with circles in them are unlikely to be the
shortest route to anywhere, and routes that do not start at the
start point do not have to be considered either. For a small graph
like Hiva Oa, it should be possible to generate all non-cyclic
(circle-free) routes starting from a certain point.

##### ○•○

But first, we will need to expand our vocabulary so we can deal
with the problem in a natural way. The words we need exist in
CoffeeScript and in the Underscore library, but we will go through
how they can be implemented, so it is clear how they function and
what they do. The example implementations will be named with an
underscore in front of their names to show they are internal and
not used in the rest of the book. You can compare with the
implementations in the [CoffeeScript Underscore
example](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/examples/underscore.coffee)
and try all the Underscore functions in the [interactive Underscore
reference](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/literate/underscore.html).

The first is a function named `_member`, which is used to determine
whether an element is found within an array. The route will be kept
as an array of names, and when arriving at a new place, the algorithm
could logically call `_member` to check whether we have been at
that place already. It could look like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
_member = (array, value) ->
  found = false
  array.forEach (element) ->
    if element is value
      found = true
  found
show _member [6, 7, "Bordeaux"], 7
~~~~

However, this will go over the whole array, even if the value is
found immediately at the first position. What wastefulness. When
using a `for` loop, you can use the `break` statement to jump out
of it, but in a `forEach` construct this will not work, because the
body of the loop is a function, and `break` statements do not jump
out of functions. One solution could be to adjust `forEach` to
recognise a certain kind of exceptions as signalling a break.
Something like `_forEach` here:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
_break = toString: -> "Break"
_forEach = (array, action) ->
  try
    for element in array
      action element
  catch exception
    if exception isnt _break
      throw exception
show _forEach [1..3], (n) -> n*n
# Which btw could in CoffeeScript be written as
show (i*i for i in [1..3])
~~~~

Now, if the `action` function throws `_break`, `_forEach` will
absorb the exception and stop looping. The object stored in the
variable `_break` is used purely as a thing to compare with. The
only reason I gave it a `toString` property is that this might be
useful to figure out what kind of strange value you are dealing
with if you somehow end up with a `_break` exception outside of a
`_forEach`. Now `_member` can be defined as:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
_member = (array, value) ->
  found = false
  _forEach array, (element) ->
    if element is value
      found = true
      throw _break
  found
show _member [6, 7, "Bordeaux"], 7
~~~~

Of course we could also have defined `_member` without using the
`_forEach`:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
_member = (array, value) ->
  found = false
  for element in array
    if element is value
      found = true
      break
  found
show _member [6, 7, "Bordeaux"], 7
~~~~

This function exists in Underscore as `include` aka `contains`. But
it is such a common operation that it is in fact built into
CoffeeScript with the `in` operator (outside of a `for` … `in`).
Using `in` is the preferred way to test for array membership.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show 7 in [6, 7, "Bordeaux"]
~~~~

##### ○•○

Having a way to break out of `_forEach` loops can be very useful,
but in the case of the `_member` function the result is still rather
ugly, because you need to specifically store the result and later
return it. We could add yet another kind of exception, `_return`,
which can be given a `value` property, and have `_forEach` return
this value when such an exception is thrown, but this would be
terribly ad-hoc and messy. What we really need is a whole new
higher-order function, called `any`[](#index-any) (or sometimes
`some`). It exists in Underscore under both names. A definition
more or less looks like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
_any = (array, test) ->
  for element in array
    if test element
      return true
  false

show _any [3, 4, 0, -3, 2, 1], (n) -> n < 0
show _any [3, 4, 0, 2, 1], (n) -> n < 0
# Using Underscore
show _.any [3, 4, 0, -3, 2, 1], (n) -> n < 0
~~~~

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Redefining member with any
_member = (array, value) ->
  partial = (func, a...) -> (b...) -> func a..., b...
  _.any array, partial ((a,b) -> a is b), value
show _member ["Fear", "Loathing"], "Denial"
show _member ["Fear", "Loathing"], "Loathing"
~~~~

`any` goes over the elements in an array, from left to right, and
applies the test function to them. The first time this returns a
true-ish value, it returns that value. If no true-ish value is
found, `false` is returned. Calling `any test, array` is more or
less equivalent to doing `test(array[0]) or test(array[1]) or ...`
etcetera.

##### ○•○

Just like `&&` is the companion of `||`, `any` has a companion
called `every`[](#index-every):

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
_every = (array, test) ->
  for element in array
    if not test element
      return false
  true
show _every [1, 2, 0, -1], (n) -> n isnt 0
show _every [1, 2, -1], (n) -> n isnt 0
show _.every [1, 2, -1], (n) -> n isnt 0 # Using Underscore
~~~~

##### ○•○

Another function we will need is `flatten`. This function takes an
array of arrays, and puts the elements of the arrays together in
one big array.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
_flatten = (array) ->
  result = []
  for element in array
    if _.isArray element
      result = result.concat _flatten element
    else
      result.push element
  result

show _flatten [[1], [2, [3, 4]], [5, 6]]
# Using Underscore
show _.flatten [[1], [2, [3, 4]], [5, 6]]
~~~~

#### *Exercise 27*

Before starting to generate routes, we need one more higher-order
function. This one is called `filter`[](#index-filter) (in Underscore
it is also named `select`). Like `map`, it takes a function and an
array as arguments, and produces a new array, but instead of putting
the results of calling the function in the new array, it produces
an array with only those values from the old array for which the
given function returns a true-like value. Write a `_filter` function
that shows how it works.

Imagine what an algorithm to generate routes would look like — it
starts at the starting location, and starts to generate a route for
every road leaving there. At the end of each of these roads it
continues to generate more routes. It does not run along one road,
it branches out.  Because of this, recursion[](#index-recursion)
is a natural way to model it.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
possibleRoutes = (from, to) ->
  findRoutes = (route) ->
    notVisited = (road) ->
      not (road.to in route.places)
    continueRoute = (road) ->
      findRoutes 
        places: route.places.concat([road.to]),
        length: route.length + road.distance
    end = route.places[route.places.length - 1]
    if end is to
      [route]
    else
      _.flatten _.map _.filter(roadsFrom(end), notVisited),
                  continueRoute
  findRoutes {places: [from], length: 0}

show (possibleRoutes 'Point Teohotepapapa', 'Point Kiukiu').length
show possibleRoutes 'Hanapaoa', 'Mt Ootua' 
~~~~

The function returns an array of route objects, each of which
contains an array of places that the route passes, and a length.
`findRoutes` recursively continues a route, returning an array with
every possible extension of that route. When the end of a route is
the place where we want to go, it just returns that route, since
continuing past that place would be pointless. If it is another
place, we must go on. The `flatten`/`map`/`filter` line is probably
the hardest to read. This is what it says: 'Take all the roads going
from the current location, discard the ones that go to places that
this route has already visited. Continue each of these roads, which
will give an array of finished routes for each of them, then put
all these routes into a single big array that we return.'

That line does a lot. This is why good abstractions help: They allow
you to say complicated things without typing pages of code.

Does this not recurse forever, seeing how it calls itself (via
`continueRoute`)? No, at some point, all outgoing roads will go to
places that a route has already passed, and the result of `filter`
will be an empty array. Mapping over an empty array produces an
empty array, and flattening that still gives an empty array. So
calling `findRoutes` on a dead end produces an empty array, meaning
'there are no ways to continue this route'.

Notice that places are appended to routes by using
`concat`[](#index-concat), not `push`[](#index-push). The `concat`
method creates a new array, while `push` modifies the existing
array. Because the function might branch off several routes from a
single partial route, we must not modify the array that represents
the original route, because it must be used several times.

#### *Exercise 28*

Now that we have all possible routes, let us try to find the shortest
one. Write a function `shortestRoute` that, like `possibleRoutes`,
takes the names of a starting and ending location as arguments. It
returns a single route object, of the type that `possibleRoutes`
produces.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here

~~~~ {.coffeescript}

  currentShortest = null
  _.each possibleRoutes(from, to), (route) ->
    if not currentShortest or
       currentShortest.length > route.length
      currentShortest = route 
  currentShortest
~~~~

The tricky thing in 'minimising' or 'maximising' algorithms is to
not screw up when given an empty array. In this case, we happen to
know that there is at least one road between every two places, so
we could just ignore it. But that would be a bit lame. What if the
road from Puamua to Mount Ootua, which is steep and muddy, is washed
away by a rainstorm? It would be a shame if this caused our function
to break as well, so it takes care to return `null` when no routes
are found.

Then, the very functional, abstract-everything-we-can approach:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
minimise = (func, array) ->
  minScore = null
  found = null
  _.each array, (element) ->
    score = func element
    if minScore is null or score < minScore
      minScore = score
      found = element
  found

getProperty = (propName) ->
  (object) -> object[propName]

shortestRouteAbstract = (from, to) ->
  minimise getProperty('length'),
           possibleRoutes(from, to)
~~~~

Unfortunately, it is two times longer than the other version. In
programs where you need to minimise several things it might be a
good idea to write the generic algorithm like this, so you can
re-use it. In most cases the first version is probably good enough.

Note the `getProperty`[](#index-getProperty) function though, it
is often useful when doing functional programming with objects.

####

Let us see what route our algorithm comes up with between Point
Kiukiu and Point Teohotepapapa…

On a small island like Hiva Oa, it is not too much work to generate
all possible routes. If you try to do that on a reasonably detailed
map of, say, Belgium, it is going to take an absurdly long time,
not to mention an absurd amount of memory. Still, you have probably
seen those online route-planners. These give you a more or less
optimal route through a gigantic maze of roads in just a few seconds.
How do they do it?

If you are paying attention, you may have noticed that it is not
necessary to generate all routes all the way to the end. If we start
comparing routes *while* we are building them, we can avoid building
this big set of routes, and, as soon as we have found a single route
to our destination, we can stop extending routes that are already
longer than that route.

What you see here is an elevation map of a mountain landscape. The
yellowish spots are the peaks, and the dark spots the valleys. The
area is divided into squares with a size of a hundred meters. We
have at our disposal a function `heightAt`, which can give us the
height, in meters, of any square on that map, where squares are
represented by objects with `x` and `y` properties.

We want to cross this landscape, on foot, from the top left to the
bottom right. A grid can be approached like a graph. Every square
is a node, which is connected to the squares around it.

We do not like wasting energy, so we would prefer to take the easiest
route possible. Going uphill is heavier than going downhill, and
going downhill is heavier than going level[^U]. This function
calculates the amount of 'weighted meters', between two adjacent
squares, which represents how tired you get from walking (or climbing)
between them. Going uphill is counted as twice as heavy as going
downhill.

Note the `flatDistance` calculation. If the two points are on the
same row or column, they are right next to each other, and the
distance between them is a hundred meters. Otherwise, they are
assumed to be diagonally adjacent, and the diagonal distance between
two squares of this size is a hundred times the square root of two,
which is approximately `141`. One is not allowed to call this
function for squares that are further than one step apart. (It could
double-check this… but it is too lazy.)

Points on the map are represented by objects containing `x` and `y`

If we are going to find routes through this map, we will again need
a function to create 'signposts', lists of directions that can be
taken from a given point. Write a function `possibleDirections`,
which takes a point object as argument and returns an array of
nearby points. We can only move to adjacent points, both straight
and diagonally, so squares have a maximum of eight neighbours. Take
care not to return squares that lie outside of the map. For all we
know the edge of the map might be the edge of the world.

I created a variable `mapSize`, for the sole purpose of not having
to write `20` two times. If, at some other time, we want to use
this same function for another map, it would be clumsy if the code
was full of `20`s, which all have to be changed. We could even go
as far as making the `mapSize` an argument to `possibleDirections`,
so we can use the function for different maps without changing it.
I judged that that was not necessary in this case, such things can
be changed when the need arises. Then why did I not add a variable
to hold the `0`, which also occurs two times? I assumed that maps
always start at `0`, so this one is unlikely to ever change, and
using a variable for it only adds noise.

####

To find a route on this map without having our browser cut off the
program because it takes too long to finish, we have to stop our
amateurish attempts and implement a serious algorithm. A lot of
work has gone into problems like this in the past, and many solutions
have been designed (some brilliant, others useless). A very popular
and efficient one is called A\*[](#index-A*) (pronounced A-star).
We will spend the rest of the chapter implementing an A\* route-finding
function for our map.

Before I get to the algorithm itself, let me tell you a bit more
about the problem it solves. The trouble with searching routes
through graphs is that, in big graphs, there are an awful lot of
them. Our Hiva Oa path-finder showed that, when the graph is small,
all we needed to do was to make sure our paths did not revisit
points they had already passed. On our new map, this is not enough
anymore.

The fundamental problem is that there is too much room for going
in the wrong direction. Unless we somehow manage to steer our
exploration of paths towards the goal, a choice we make for continuing
a given path is more likely to go in the wrong direction than in
the right direction. If you keep generating paths like that, you
end up with an enormous amount of paths, and even if one of them
accidentally reaches the end point, you do not know whether that
is the shortest path.

So what you want to do is explore directions that are likely to get
you to the end point first. On a grid like our map, you can get a
rough estimate of how good a path is by checking how long it is and
how close its end is to the end point. By adding path length and
an estimate of the distance it still has to go, you can get a rough
idea of which paths are promising. If you extend promising paths
first, you are less likely to waste time on useless ones.

##### ○•○

But that still is not enough. If our map was of a perfectly flat
plane, the path that looked promising would almost always be the
best one, and we could use the above method to walk right to our
goal. But we have valleys and hillsides blocking our paths, so it
is hard to tell in advance which direction will be the most efficient
path. Because of this, we still end up having to explore way too
many paths.

To correct this, we can make clever use of the fact that we are
constantly exploring the most promising path first. Once we have
determined that path A is the best way to get to point X, we can
remember that. When, later on, path B also gets to point X, we know
that it is not the best route, so we do not have to explore it
further. This can prevent our program from building a lot of pointless
paths.

##### ○•○

The algorithm, then, goes something like this…

There are two pieces of data to keep track of. The first one is
called the open list, it contains the partial routes that must still
be explored. Each route has a score, which is calculated by adding
its length to its estimated distance from the goal. This estimate
must always be optimistic, it should never overestimate the distance.
The second is a set of nodes that we have seen, together with the
shortest partial route that got us there. This one we will call the
reached list.  We start by adding a route that contains only the
starting node to the open list, and recording it in the reached
list.

Then, as long as there are any nodes in the open list, we take out
the one that has the lowest (best) score, and find the ways in which
it can be continued (by calling `possibleDirections`). For each of
the nodes this returns, we create a new route by appending it to
our original route, and adjusting the length of the route using
`weightedDistance`. The endpoint of each of these new routes is
then looked up in the reached list.

If the node is not in the reached list yet, it means we have not
seen it before, and we add the new route to the open list and record
it in the reached list. If we *had* seen it before, we compare the
score of the new route to the score of the route in the reached
list. If the new route is shorter, we replace the existing route
with the new one.  Otherwise, we discard the new route, since we
have already seen a better way to get to that point.

We continue doing this until the route we fetch from the open list
ends at the goal node, in which case we have found our route, or
until the open list is empty, in which case we have found out that
there is no route. In our case the map contains no unsurmountable
obstacles, so there is always a route.

How do we know that the first full route that we get from the open
list is also the shortest one? This is a result of the fact that
we only look at a route when it has the lowest score. The score of
a route is its actual length plus an *optimistic* estimate of the
remaining length.  This means that if a route has the lowest score
in the open list, it is always the best route to its current endpoint
— it is impossible for another route to later find a better way to
that point, because if it were better, its score would have been
lower.

##### ○•○

Try not to get frustrated when the fine points of why this works
are still eluding you. When thinking about algorithms like this,
having seen 'something like it' before helps a lot, it gives you a
point of reference to compare the approach to. Beginning programmers
have to do without such a point of reference, which makes it rather
easy to get lost. Just realise that this is advanced stuff, globally
read over the rest of the chapter, and come back to it later when
you feel like a challenge.

##### ○•○

I am afraid that, for one aspect of the algorithm, I am going to
have to invoke magic again. The open list needs to be able to hold
a large amount of routes, and to quickly find the route with the
lowest score among them. Storing them in a normal array, and searching
through this array every time, is way too slow, so I give you a
data structure called a binary heap[](#index-binary-heap). You
create them with `new`, just like `Date` objects, giving them a
function that is used to 'score' its elements as argument. The
resulting object has the methods `push` and `pop`, just like an
array, but `pop` always gives you the element with the lowest score,
instead of the one that was `push`ed last.

[Binary Heaps↓](#binary-heaps) discusses the implementation

The need to squeeze out as much efficiency as we can has another
effect.  The Hiva Oa algorithm used arrays of locations to store
routes, and copied them with the `concat` method when it extended
them. This time, we can not afford to copy arrays, since we will
be exploring lots and lots of routes. Instead, we use a 'chain' of
objects to store a route. Every object in the chain has some
properties, such as a point on the map, and the length of the route
so far, and it also has a property that points at the previous
object in the chain. Something like this:

![figure ../img/objectchain-small.png](../img/objectchain-small.png)\


Where the blue circles are the relevant objects, and the lines
represent properties — the end points are the values of the property.
Object `A` is the start of a route here. Object `B` is used to build
a new route, which continues from `A`. It has a property, which we
will call `from`, pointing at the route it is based on. When we
need to reconstruct a route later, we can follow these properties
to find all the points that the route passed. Note that object `B`
is part of two routes, one that ends in `D` and one that ends in
`E`. When there are a lot of routes, this can save us much storage
space — every new route only needs one new object for itself, the
rest is shared with other routes that started the same way.

#### *Exercise 30*

Write a function `estimatedDistance` that gives an optimistic
estimate of the distance between two points. It does not have to
look at the height data, but can assume a flat map.  Remember that
we are only travelling straight and diagonally, and that we are
counting the diagonal distance between two squares as `141`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
estimatedDistance = (pointA, pointB) ->
  dx = Math.abs pointA.x - pointB.x
  dy = Math.abs pointA.y - pointB.y
  if dx > dy
    (dx - dy) * 100 + dy * 141
  else
    (dy - dx) * 100 + dx * 141

show estimatedDistance point(3,3), point(9,6)
~~~~

The strange formulae are used to decompose the path into a straight
and a diagonal part. If you have a path like this…

![figure ../img/diagonalpath-small.png](../img/diagonalpath-small.png)\


… the path is `6` squares wide and `3` high, so you get `6 - 3 = 3`
straight moves, and `3` diagonal ones.

If you wrote a function that just computes the straight 'Pythagorean'
distance between the points, that would also work. What we need is
an optimistic estimate, and assuming you can go straight to the
goal is certainly optimistic. However, the closer the estimate is
to the real distance, the less useless paths our program has to try
out.

#### *Exercise 31*

We will use a binary heap for the open list. What would be a good
data structure for the reached list? This one will be used to look
up routes, given a pair of `x`, `y` coordinates. Preferably in a
way that is fast. Write three functions named `makeReachedList`,
`storeReached`, and `findReached`. The first one creates your data
structure, the second one, given a reached list, a point, and a
route, stores a route in it, and the last one, given a reached list
and point, retrieves a route or returns `undefined` to indicate
that no route was found for that point.

One reasonable idea would be to use an object with objects in it.
One of the coordinates in the points, say `x`, is used as a property
name for the outer object, and the other, `y`, for the inner object.
This does require some bookkeeping to handle the fact that, sometimes,
the inner object we are looking for is not there (yet).

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
makeReachedList = -> {}

storeReached = (list, point, route) ->
  inner = list[point.x]

    inner = {}
    list[point.x] = inner
  inner[point.y] = route

findReached = (list, point) ->
  inner = list[point.x]
  if inner is undefined
    undefined
  else
    inner[point.y]
~~~~

Another possibility is to merge the `x` and `y` of the point into
a single property name, and use that to store routes in a single
object.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
pointID = (point) ->
  point.x + '-' + point.y

storeReached = (list, point, route) ->
  list[pointID(point)] = route
findReached = (list, point) ->
  list[pointID(point)]

[](#index-encapsulation)Defining a type of data structure by
providing a set of functions to create and manipulate such structures
is a useful technique. It makes it possible to 'isolate' the code
that makes use of the structure from the details of the structure
itself. Note that, no matter which of the above two implementations
is used, code that needs a reached list works in exactly the same
way. It does not care what kind of objects are used, as long as it
gets the results it expected.

This will be discussed in much more detail in [Object
Orientation↓](#object-oriented-programming), where we will learn to
make object types like `BinaryHeap`, which are created using `new`
and have methods to manipulate them.

Here we finally have the actual path-finding function:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
findRoute = (from, to) ->
 
  routeScore = (route) ->
    if route.score is undefined
      route.score = route.length +
        estimatedDistance route.point, to
    route.score

  addOpenRoute = (route) ->
    open.push route
    storeReached reached, route.point, route

  open = new BinaryHeap routeScore
  reached = makeReachedList()
  addOpenRoute point: from, length: 0

  while open.size() > 0
    route = open.pop()
    if samePoint route.point, to
      return route

    _.each possibleDirections(route.point),
      (direction) ->
        known = findReached reached, direction
        newLength = route.length +
          weightedDistance route.point, direction
        if not known or known.length > newLength
          if known
            open.remove known
          addOpenRoute
            point:  direction,
            from:   route,
            length: newLength
  return null
~~~~

First, it creates the data structures it needs, one open list and
one reached list.  `routeScore` is the scoring function given to
the binary heap. Note how it stores its result in the route object,
to prevent having to re-calculate it multiple times.  `addOpenRoute`
is a convenience function that adds a new route to both the open
list and the reached list. It is immediately used to add the start
of the route. Note that route objects always have the properties
`point`, which holds the point at the end of the route, and `length`,
which holds the current length of the route. Routes which are more
than one square long also have a `from` property, which points at
their predecessors.

The `while` loop, as was described in the algorithm, keeps taking
the lowest-scoring route from the open list and checks whether this
gets us to the goal point. If it does not, we must continue by
expanding it. This is what the `_.each` takes care of. It looks
up this new point in the reached list. If it is not found there,
or the node found has a longer length that the new route, a new
route object is created and added to the open list and reached list,
and the existing route (if any) is removed from the open list.

What if the route in `known` is not on the open list? It has to be,
because routes are only removed from the open list when they have
been found to be the most optimal route to their endpoint. If we
try to remove a value from a binary heap that is not on it, it will
throw an exception, so if my reasoning is wrong, we will probably
see an exception when running the function.

When code gets complex enough to make you doubt certain things about
it, it is a good idea to add some checks that raise exceptions when
something goes wrong. That way, you know that there are no weird
things happening 'silently', and when you break something, you
immediately see what you broke.

##### ○•○

Note that this algorithm does not use recursion, but still manages
to explore all those branches. The open list more or less takes
over the role that the function call stack played in the recursive
solution to the Hiva Oa problem — it keeps track of the paths that
still have to be explored. Every recursive algorithm can be rewritten
in a non-recursive way by using a data structure to store the 'things
that must still be done'.

Well, let us try our path-finder:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
route = findRoute point(0, 0), point(19, 19)
runOnDemand -> show route
~~~~

If you ran all the code above, and did not introduce any errors,
that call, though it might take an instant to run, should give us
a route object. This object is rather hard to read. That can be
helped by using the `showRoute` function which will show a route
as a list of coordinates.

You can also pass multiple routes to `showRoute`, which can be
useful when you are, for example, trying to plan a scenic route,
which must include the beautiful viewpoint at (`11`, `17`).

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
traverseRoute = (routes..., func) ->
  _.each [routes...], (route) ->
    while route
      func
        x: route.point.x
        y: route.point.y
      route = route.from

showRoute = (routes...) ->
  traverseRoute routes..., show

runOnDemand ->
  show '\n   Easy route'

  showRoute findRoute(point( 0,  0), point(11, 17)),
            findRoute(point(11, 17), point(19, 19))
~~~~

If the order the points were listed in were difficult to follow
then the list can be refined. Sorting it and removing duplicates
can help.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
showSortedRoute = (routes...) ->
  points = []
  traverseRoute routes..., (point) -> points.push point
  # A sort needs a function that compares two points 
  # Pattern matching can decompose them into unique names
  points.sort ({x:x1, y:y1}, {x:x2, y:y2}) ->
    return dx if dx = x1 - x2
    return dy if dy = y1 - y2
    0
  # The Underscore uniq function can get rid of doublets with
  # help from a function that serializes the relevant properties
  points = _.uniq points, true, ({x, y}) -> "#{x} #{y}"
  show point for point in points

runOnDemand ->
  showSortedRoute findRoute(point( 0,  0), point(11, 17)),

You can also display routes on a map with a function like `renderRoute`.
A web page with a map is created and the route points are used
to create and position a series of small images. You can return
later to the  techniques that are used in its implementation. They
are presented in the next chapters: objects in [Object

[Modularity↓](#modularity) and pattern matching in [Language

There is a different implementation in the source download: A web
page with the map is served to your browser, then the route points
are transferred via WebSockets to a snippet of CoffeeScript on the
page that uses a canvas to draw the points on top of the map. There
is more on that kind of thing in [Modularity↓](#modularity). The map
looks like this:

Variations on the theme of search[](#index-search)ing an optimal
route through a graph can be applied to many problems, many of which
are not at all related to finding a physical path. For example, a
program that needs to solve a puzzle of fitting a number of blocks
into a limited space could do this by exploring the various 'paths'
it gets by trying to put a certain block in a certain place. The
paths that ends up with insufficient room for the last blocks are
dead ends, and the path that manages to fit in all blocks is the
solution.

### Object-oriented Programming

* * * * * * * * * *


In the early nineties, a thing called object-oriented
programming[](#index-object-oriented-programming) stirred up the
software industry. Most of the ideas behind it were not really new
at the time, but they had finally gained enough momentum to start
rolling, to become fashionable. Books were being written, courses
given, programming languages developed. All of a sudden, everybody
was extolling the virtues of object-orientation, enthusiastically
applying it to every problem, convincing themselves they had finally
found the *right way to write programs*.

These things happen a lot. When a process is hard and confusing,
people are always on the lookout for a magic solution. When something
looking like such a solution presents itself, they are prepared to
become devoted followers. For many programmers — even today —
object-orientation (or their view of it) is the gospel. When a
program is not 'truly object-oriented', whatever that means, it is
considered decidedly inferior.

Few fads have managed to stay popular for as long as this one,
though.  Object-orientation's longevity can largely be explained
by the fact that the ideas at its core are very solid and useful.
In this chapter, we will discuss these ideas, along with CoffeeScript's
(rather succinct) take on them. The above paragraphs are by no means
meant to discredit these ideas. What I want to do is warn the reader
against developing an unhealthy attachment to them.

##### ○•○

As the name suggests, object-oriented programming is related to
objects.  The central ideas are encapsulation, inheritance, and
higher-order programming (using the same names in different types
aka polymorphism). So far, we have used objects as loose aggregations
of values, adding and altering their properties whenever we saw
fit. In an object-oriented approach, objects are viewed as little
worlds of their own, and the outside world may touch them only
through a limited and well-defined interface[](#index-interface),
a number of specific methods and properties. The 'reached list' we
used at the end of [Searching↑](#searching) is an example of this:
We used only three functions, `makeReachedList`, `storeReached`,
and `findReached` to interact with it. These three functions form
an interface for such objects.

The `Date`, `Error`, and `BinaryHeap` objects we have seen also
work like this. Instead of providing regular functions for working
with the objects, they provide a way to create such objects, using
the `new` keyword, and a number of methods and properties that
provide the rest of the interface.

##### ○•○

One way to give an object methods is to attach function values to
it.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
rabbit = {}
rabbit.speak = (line) ->
  show "The rabbit says '#{line}'"
rabbit.speak "Well, now you're asking me."
~~~~

In most cases, the method will need to know *who* it should act on.
For example, if there are different rabbits, the `speak` method
must indicate which rabbit is speaking. For this purpose, there is
a special variable called `this`[](#index-this), which is always
present when a function is called, and which points at the relevant
object when the function is called as a method. A function is called
as a method when it is looked up as a property, and immediately
called, as in `object.method()`. Since it is very common to use
`this` inside an object, it can be abbreviated from `this.property`
or `this.method()` to `@property` or `@method()`.

fatRabbit = adjective: "fat", speak: speak

                  "how late it's getting!"
fatRabbit.speak "I could sure use a carrot right now."

I can now clarify the mysterious first argument to the
`apply`[](#index-apply) method, for which we always used `null`
in [Functional Programming↑](#functional-programming). This
argument can be used to specify the object that the function must
be applied to. For non-method functions, this is irrelevant, hence
the `null`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
speak.apply fatRabbit, ['Yum.']
~~~~

Functions also have a `call`[](#index-call) method, which is similar
to `apply`, but you can give the arguments for the function separately
instead of as an array:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
speak.call fatRabbit, 'Burp.'
~~~~

##### ○•○

It is common in object oriented terminology to refer to instances
of something as an object. The `whiteRabbit` and `fatRabbit` can
be seen as different instances of a more general `Rabbit` concept.
In CoffeeScript such concepts are termed a `class`[](#index-class).

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class Rabbit
  constructor: (@adjective) ->
  speak: (line) ->
    show "The #{@adjective} rabbit says '#{line}'"

whiteRabbit = new Rabbit "white"
fatRabbit = new Rabbit "fat"

whiteRabbit.speak "Hurry!"
fatRabbit.speak "Tasty!"
~~~~

It is a convention, among CoffeeScript programmers, to start the
names of classes with a capital letter. This makes it easy to
distinguish them from object instances and functions.

##### ○•○

The `new`[](#index-new) keyword provides a convenient way of
creating new objects. When a function is called with the word `new`
in front of it, its `this`[](#index-this) variable will point at
a *new* object, which it will automatically return (unless it
explicitly returns something else).  Functions used to create new
objects like this are called constructor[](#index-constructor)s.

The constructor for the `Rabbit` class is `constructor: (@adjective)
->`. The `@adjective` argument to the constructor does two things:
It declares `adjective` as a property on `this` and it uses 'pattern
matching' i.e. the same name to assign the argument named `adjective`
to a property on `this` that is also named `adjective`. It could
have been written in full form as `constructor: (adjective) ->
this.adjective = adjective`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
killerRabbit = new Rabbit 'killer'
killerRabbit.speak 'GRAAAAAAAAAH!'
show killerRabbit
~~~~

When `new Rabbit` is called with the `'killer'` argument, the
argument is assigned to a property named `adjective`.
So `show killerRabbit` ⇒ `{adjective: 'killer'}`.

Why is the `new` keyword even necessary? After all, we could have
simply written this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
makeRabbit = (adjective) ->
  adjective: adjective
  speak: (line) -> show adjective + ': ' + line
blackRabbit = makeRabbit 'black'
~~~~

But that is not entirely the same.  `new` does a few things behind
the scenes. For one thing, our `killerRabbit` has a property called
`constructor`[](#index-constructor), which points at the `Rabbit`
function that created it. `blackRabbit` also has such a property,
but it points at the `Object`[](#index-Object) function. They even
have `name` properties so we can check them:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show killerRabbit.constructor.name
~~~~

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show blackRabbit.constructor.name
~~~~

##### ○•○

The objects that are created, `whiteRabbit` and `fatRabbit`, are
specific instances. The `whiteRabbit` is not all kinds of white
rabbits just a single one that happen to have the name whiteRabbit.
If you want to create a class of say weight conscious rabbits then
the `extends`[](#index-extends) keyword can help you accomplish
that.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class WeightyRabbit extends Rabbit
  constructor: (adjective, @weight) ->
    super adjective
  adjustedWeight: (relativeGravity) ->
    (@weight * relativeGravity).toPrecision 2

tinyRabbit = new WeightyRabbit "tiny", 1.01
jumboRabbit = new WeightyRabbit "jumbo", 7.47

moonGravity = 1/6
jumboRabbit.speak "Carry me, I weigh 
#{jumboRabbit.adjustedWeight(moonGravity)} stones"
tinyRabbit.speak "He ain't heavy, he is my brother"
~~~~

The call `super adjective` passes the argument on to the `Rabbit`
constructor. A method in a derived class can with `super`[](#index-super)
call upon a method of the same name in its parent class.

##### ○•○

Inheritance is useful because different types can share a single
implementation of an algorithm. But it comes with a price-tag: the
derived classes become tightly coupled to the parent class. Normally
you make each part of a system as independent as possible, for
example avoiding global variables and using arguments instead. That
way you can read and understand each part in isolation and you can
change them with little risk of breaking other parts of the system.

Due to the tight coupling that inheritance introduces it can be
difficult to change a parent class without inadvertently risk
breaking derived classes. This is called the fragile base
class[](#index-fragile-base-class) problem. A class that has no
child classes and is only used through its published methods and
properties can normally be changed quite freely — as long as the
published methods and properties stay the same. When a class derives
from it, then the child class may depend on the internal behaviour
of the parent and it becomes problematic to change the base class.

To understand a derived class you will often have to understand the
parent first. The implementation is distributed, instead of reading
down through a function, you may have to look in different places
where a class and its parent and their parent… implement each their
part of the combined logic. Lets look at an example that matters —
the balance on your bank account.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class Account
  constructor: -> @balance = 0
  transfer: (amount) -> @balance += amount
  getBalance: -> @balance
  batchTransfer: (amtList) ->
    for amount in amtList
      @transfer amount

yourAccount = new Account()
oldBalance = yourAccount.getBalance()
yourAccount.transfer salary = 1000
newBalance = yourAccount.getBalance()
show "Books balance:
 #{salary is newBalance - oldBalance}."
~~~~

Hopefully this only shows the principle of how your bank has
implemented its accounts. An account starts out with a zero balance,
money can be credited (positive transfer) and debited (negative
transfer), the balance can be shown and multiple transfers can be
handled.

Other parts of the system can balance the books by checking that
transfers match the differences on the accounts. Those parts of the
system were unfortunately not known to the developer of the
`AccountWithFee` class.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class AccountWithFee extends Account
  fee: 5
  transfer: (amount) ->
    super amount - @fee
    # feeAccount.transfer @fee

yourAccount = new AccountWithFee()
oldBalance = yourAccount.getBalance()
yourAccount.transfer salary = 1000
newBalance = yourAccount.getBalance()
show "Books balance:
 #{salary is newBalance - oldBalance}."
~~~~

The books no longer balance. The issue is that the `AccountWithFee`
class has violated what is called the substitution
principle[](#index-substitution-principle). It is a patch of the
existing `Account` class and it breaks programs that assume that
all account classes behave in a certain way. In a system with
thousands of classes such patches can cause severe problems. To
avoid this kind of problem it is up to the developer to ensure that
inherited classes can fully substitute their parent classes.

To avoid excessive fraudulent transactions when a card is lost or
stolen, the bank has implemented a system which checks that withdrawals
do not exceed a daily limit. The `LimitedAccount` class checks each
`transfer`, reduces the `@dailyLimit` and reports an error if it
is exceeded.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class LimitedAccount extends Account
  constructor: -> super; @resetLimit()
  resetLimit: -> @dailyLimit = 50
  transfer: (amount) ->
    if amount < 0 and (@dailyLimit += amount) < 0
      throw new Error "You maxed out!"
    else
      super amount
lacc = new LimitedAccount()
lacc.transfer 50
show "Start balance #{lacc.getBalance()}"

try lacc.batchTransfer [-1..-10]
catch error then show error.message
show "After batch balance #{lacc.getBalance()}"
~~~~

Your bank is so successful that `batchTransfer` has to be speeded
up (a real version would involve database updates).  The developer,
that got the task of making `batchTransfer` faster, had been on
vacation when the `LimitedAccount` class was implemented and did
not see it among the thousands of other classes in the system.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class Account
  constructor: -> @balance = 0
  transfer: (amount) -> @balance += amount
  getBalance: -> @balance
  batchTransfer: (amtList) ->
    add = (a,b) -> a+b
    sum = (list) -> _.reduce list, add, 0
    @balance += sum amtList

class LimitedAccount extends Account
  constructor: -> super; @resetLimit()
  resetLimit: -> @dailyLimit = 50
  transfer: (amount) ->
    if amount < 0 and (@dailyLimit += amount) < 0
      throw new Error "You maxed out!"
    else
      super amount

lacc = new LimitedAccount()
lacc.transfer 50
show "Starting with #{lacc.getBalance()}"

try lacc.batchTransfer [-1..-10]
catch error then show error.message
show "After batch balance #{lacc.getBalance()}"
~~~~

Instead of the previous implementation that called `transfer` each
time, the whole batch is added together and the balance is directly
updated. That made `batchTransfer` much faster, but it also broke
the `LimitedAccount` class. It is an example of the fragile base
class[](#index-fragile-base-class) problem. In this limited example
it is easy to spot the issue, in a large system it can cause
considerable headache.

Using inheritance in the right way requires careful and thoughtful
programming. If your child classes are type compatible with their
parent then you are adhering to the substitution principle. Usually
using ownership is more appropriate, that is when a class has an
instance of another class inside it and uses its public interface.

It is a common convention in CoffeeScript to use an `_` in front
of methods that are to be considered private.

Where did the `constructor` property come from? It is part of the
prototype[](#index-prototype) of a rabbit. Prototypes are a powerful,
if somewhat confusing, part of the way CoffeeScript objects work.
Every object is based on a prototype, which gives it a set of
inherent properties. Simple objects are based on the most basic
prototype, which is associated with the `Object` constructor. In
fact, typing `{}` is equivalent to typing `new Object()`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
simpleObject = {}
show simpleObject.constructor.name
show simpleObject.toString()
~~~~

`toString`[](#index-toString) is a method that is part of the
`Object` prototype. This means that all simple objects have a
`toString` method, which converts them to a string. Our rabbit
objects are based on the prototype associated with the `Rabbit`
constructor. You can use a constructor's `prototype` property to
get access to, well, their prototype:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show _.methods Rabbit
show _.methods Rabbit.prototype
show Rabbit.prototype.constructor.name
Rabbit.prototype.speak 'I am generic' 
Rabbit::speak 'I am not initialized'
~~~~

Instead of `Rabbit.prototype.speak` you can write `Rabbit::speak`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
Rabbit::speak 'I am not initialized'
~~~~

Every function automatically gets a `prototype` property, whose
`constructor` property points back at the function. Because the
rabbit prototype is itself an object, it is based on the `Object`
prototype, and shares its `toString`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show killerRabbit.toString is simpleObject.toString
~~~~

##### ○•○

Even though objects seem to share the properties of their prototype,
this sharing is one-way. The properties of the prototype influence
the object based on it, but the properties of this object never
change the prototype.

The precise rules are this: When looking up the value of a property,
CoffeeScript first looks at the properties that the object *itself*
has.  If there is a property that has the name we are looking for,
that is the value we get. If there is no such property, it continues
searching the prototype of the object, and then the prototype of
the prototype, and so on. If no property is found, the value
`undefined` is given. On the other hand, when *setting* the value
of a property, CoffeeScript never goes to the prototype, but always
sets the property in the object itself.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
Rabbit::teeth = 'small'
show killerRabbit.teeth

killerRabbit.teeth = 'long, sharp, and bloody'
show killerRabbit.teeth

show Rabbit::teeth
~~~~

This does mean that the prototype can be be used at any time to add
new properties and methods to all objects based on it. For example,
it might become necessary for our rabbits to dance.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
Rabbit::dance = ->
  show "The #{@adjective} rabbit dances a jig."
killerRabbit.dance()
~~~~

And, as you might have guessed, the prototypical rabbit is the
perfect place for values that all rabbits have in common, such as
the `speak` method. Here is a new approach to the `Rabbit` constructor:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
Rabbit = (adjective) ->
  @adjective = adjective

Rabbit::speak = (line) ->
  show "The #{@adjective} rabbit says '#{line}'"

hazelRabbit = new Rabbit "hazel"
hazelRabbit.speak "Good Frith!"
~~~~

##### ○•○

The fact that all objects have a prototype and receive some properties
from this prototype can be tricky. It means that using an object
to store a set of things, such as the cats from [Data
Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays), can go wrong.
If, for example, we wondered whether there is a cat called
`'constructor'`, we would have checked it like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
noCatsAtAll = {}
if "constructor" of noCatsAtAll
  show "Yes, there is a cat called 'constructor'."
~~~~

This is problematic. A related problem is that it can often be
practical to extend the prototypes of standard constructors such
as `Object` and `Array` with new useful functions. For example, we
could give all objects a method called `allProperties`, which returns
an array with the names of the (non-hidden) properties that the
object has:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
Object::allProperties = ->
  for property of this
    property

test = x: 10, y: 3
show test.allProperties()
delete Object::allProperties
~~~~

And that immediately shows the problem. Now that the `Object`
prototype has a property called `allProperties`, looping over the
properties of any object, using `for` and `of`[](#index-of), will
also give us that shared property, which is generally not what we
want. We are interested only in the properties that the object
itself has.

Fortunately, there is a way to find out whether a property belongs
to the object itself or to one of its prototypes. Every object has
a method called `hasOwnProperty`[](#index-hasOwnProperty), which
tells us whether the object has a property with a given name. When
looping over the properties of an object CoffeeScript provides a
keyword `own` so we are saved from using a clumsy `if` test on each
property. Using `own`, we can write an `ownProperties` method like
this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
Object::ownProperties = ->
  for own property of this
    property

test = 'Fat Igor': true, 'Fireball': true
show test.ownProperties()
delete Object::ownProperties
~~~~

[](#index-forEachOf)And of course, we can abstract that into a
higher-order function. Note that the `action` function is called
with both the name of the property and the value it has in the
object.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
forEachOf = (object, action) ->
  for own property, value of object
    action property, value

chimera = head: "lion", body: "goat", tail: "snake"
forEachOf chimera, (name, value) ->
  view "The #{name} of a #{value}."
~~~~

But, what if we find a cat named `hasOwnProperty`? (You never know.)
It will be stored in the object, and the next time we want to go
over the collection of cats, calling `object.hasOwnProperty` will
fail, because that property no longer points at a function value.
This can be solved by doing something ugly:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
forEachIn = (object, action) ->
  for property of object
    if Object::hasOwnProperty.call object, property
      action property, object[property]

test = name: "Mordecai", hasOwnProperty: "Uh-oh"
forEachIn test, (name, value) ->
  view "Property #{name} = #{value}"
~~~~

Here, instead of using the method found in the object itself, we
get the method from the `Object` prototype, and then use `call` to
apply it to the right object. Unless someone actually messes with
the `Object.prototype` method (do not do that), this should work
correctly.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
test = name: "Mordecai", hasOwnProperty: "Uh-oh"
for own property, value of test
  show "Property #{property} = #{value}"
~~~~

Fortunately the `own` keyword saves the day even in this situation,
so it is the right thing to use.

##### ○•○

`hasOwnProperty` can also be used in those situations where we have
been using the `of`[](#index-of) operator to see whether an object
has a specific property. There is one more catch, however. We saw
in [Data Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays) that
some properties, such as `toString`, are 'hidden', and do not show
up when going over properties with `for`/`of`. It turns out that
browsers in the Gecko family (Firefox, most importantly) give every
object a hidden property named `__proto__`, which points to the
prototype of that object.  `hasOwnProperty` will return `true` for
this one, even though the program did not explicitly add it. Having
access to the prototype of an object can be very convenient, but
making it a property like that was not a very good idea. Still,
Firefox is a widely used browser, so when you write a program for
the web you have to be careful with this.

The advice here is *not* to name any of your own properties with
double underscore since they then can clash with system specific
details like `__proto__`. As mentioned before identifiers beginning
with one underscore is fine and used to indicate something private
to your implementation. There is a method
`propertyIsEnumerable`[](#index-propertyIsEnumerable), which returns
`false` for hidden properties, and which can be used to filter out
strange things like `__proto__`. An expression such as this one can
be used to reliably work around this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
obj = foo: 'bar'

# This test is needed to avoid hidden properties ...
show Object::hasOwnProperty.call(obj, 'foo') and
     Object::propertyIsEnumerable.call(obj, 'foo')
# ... because this returns true ...
show Object::hasOwnProperty.call(obj, '__proto__')
# ... this is required to get false.
show Object::hasOwnProperty.call(obj, '__proto__') and
     Object::propertyIsEnumerable.call(obj, '__proto__')
~~~~

Nice and simple, no? This is one of the not-so-well-designed aspects
of the system underlying CoffeeScript (recondite JavaScript). Objects
play both the role of 'values with methods', for which prototypes
work great, and 'sets of properties', for which prototypes only get
in the way.

##### ○•○

Writing the above kind of expression every time you need to check
whether a property is present in an object is unworkable. We could
put it into a function, but a better approach is to write a constructor
and a prototype specifically for situations like this, where we
want to approach an object as just a set of properties. Because you
can use it to look things up by name, we will call it a
`Dictionary`[](#index-Dictionary).

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class Dictionary
  constructor: (@values = {}) ->

  store: (name, value) ->
    @values[name] = value

  lookup: (name) ->
    @values[name]

  contains: (name) ->
    Object::hasOwnProperty.call(@values, name) and
    Object::propertyIsEnumerable.call(@values, name)

  each: (action) ->
    for own property, value of @values
      action property, value

colours = new Dictionary
  Grover: 'blue'
  Elmo:   'orange'
  Bert:   'yellow'

show colours.contains 'Grover'
colours.each (name, colour) ->
  view name + ' is ' + colour
~~~~

Now the whole mess related to approaching objects as plain sets of
properties has been 'encapsulated' in a convenient interface: one
constructor and four methods. Note that the `values` property of a
`Dictionary` object is not part of this interface, it is an internal
detail, and when you are using `Dictionary` objects you do not need
to directly use it.

##### ○•○

Whenever you write an interface, it is a good idea to add a comment
with a quick sketch of what it does and how it should be used. This
way, when someone, possibly yourself three months after you wrote
it, wants to work with the interface, they can quickly see how to
use it, and do not have to study the whole program.

![figure ../img/sketch-small.png](../img/sketch-small.png)\


Using a piece of paper, a whiteboard or as here a pen and tablet
can be effective to sketch your designs. Using a notation roughly
similar to UML (Unified Modeling Language) can help in communicating
your design to others. Usually you do not need a tool[^V] — unless
you really want to or work in a large administrative setting. You
can find a quick reference to UML notation via web search. The most
useful diagram is the interaction or sequence diagram. Use it to
specify how objects talk to each other — especially in distributed
systems. The class diagram shown above presents a static view of
the system so it is mostly for initial designs.

[^V]:  A few integrated development environments automatically
generate diagrams as you are writing your code, for example Visual
Studio Ultimate, but it is neither cheap nor compatible with
CoffeeScript.

Most of the time, when you are designing an interface, you will
soon find some limitations and problems in whatever you came up
with, and change it. To prevent wasting your time, it is advisable
to document your interfaces only *after* they have been used in a
few real situations and proven themselves to be practical. — Of
course, this might make it tempting to forget about documentation
altogether.  Personally, I treat writing documentation as a 'finishing
touch' to add to a system. When it feels ready, it is time to write
something about it, and to see if it sounds as good in English (or
whatever language) as it does in CoffeeScript (or whatever programming
language).

##### ○•○

The distinction between the external interface of an object and its
internal details is important for two reasons. Firstly, having a
small, clearly described interface makes an object easier to use.
You only have to keep the interface in mind, and do not have to
worry about the rest unless you are changing the object itself.

Secondly, it often turns out to be necessary or practical to change
something about the internal implementation of a class, to make it
more efficient, for example, or to fix some problem. When outside
code is accessing every single property and detail in the object,
you can not change any of them without also updating a lot of other
code. If outside code only uses a small interface, you can do what
you want, as long as you do not change the interface.

Some people go very far in this. They will, for example, never
include properties in the interface of object, only methods — if
their object type has a length, it will be accessible with the
`getLength` method, not the `length` property. This way, if they
ever want to change their object in such a way that it no longer
has a `length` property, for example because it now has some internal
array whose length it must return, they can update the function
without changing the interface.

My own take is that in most cases this is not worth it. Adding a
`getLength` method which only contains `return this.length` mostly
just adds meaningless code, and, in most situations, I consider
meaningless code a bigger problem than the risk of having to
occasionally change the interface to my objects.

##### ○•○

Adding new methods to existing prototypes can be very convenient.
Especially the `Array` and `String` prototypes in CoffeeScript could
use a few more basic methods. We could, for example, replace `forEach`
and `map` with methods on arrays, and make the `startsWith` function
we wrote in [Data Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays)
a method on strings.

However, if your code has to run as a library used by others or as
a program on a web-page together with another program (either written
by you or by someone else) which uses `for`/`of` naively — the way
we have been using it so far — then adding things to prototypes,
especially the `Object` and `Array` prototype, will definitely break
something, because these loops will suddenly start seeing those new
properties. For this reason, some people prefer not to touch these
prototypes at all. Of course, if you are careful, and you do not
expect your code to have to coexist with badly-written code, adding
methods to standard prototypes is a perfectly good technique.

### Regular Expressions

* * * * * * * * * *


At various points in the previous chapters, we had to look for
patterns in string values. In [Data Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays)
we extracted date values from strings by writing out the precise
positions at which the numbers that were part of the date could be
found. Later, in [Functional Programming↑](#functional-programming),
we saw some particularly ugly pieces of code for finding certain
types of characters in a string, for example the characters that
had to be escaped in HTML output.

[](#index-regular-expression)Regular expressions are a language
for describing patterns in strings. They form a small, separate
language, which is embedded inside CoffeeScript (and in various
other programming languages, in one way or another). It is not a
very readable language — big regular expressions tend to be quite
unreadable. To make them more readable CoffeeScript has extended
regular expressions where you can generously add comments to the
different parts. Examples of these are shown later. Still regular
expressions are difficult to read, but they are a useful tool that
can really simplify string-processing programs.

##### ○•○

Just like strings get written between quotes, regular expression
patterns get written between slashes ( `/`[](#index-/)). This means
that slashes inside the expression have to be escaped.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
slash = /\//;
show 'AC/DC'.search slash
~~~~

The `search`[](#index-search) method resembles `indexOf`, but it
searches for a regular expression instead of a string. Patterns
specified by regular expressions can do a few things that strings
can not do. For a start, they allow some of their elements to match
more than a single character. In [Functional
Programming↑](#functional-programming), when extracting mark-up
from a document, we needed to find the first asterisk or opening
brace in a string. That could be done like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
asteriskOrBrace = /[\{\*]/
story = 'We noticed the *giant sloth*, ' +
        'hanging from a giant branch.';
show story.search asteriskOrBrace

The `[` and `]` characters have a special meaning inside a regular
expression. They can enclose a set of characters, and they mean
'any of these characters'.  Most non-alphanumeric characters have
some special meaning inside a regular expression, so it is a good
idea to always escape them with a backslash[^W] when you use them
to refer to the actual characters.

[^W]:  In this case, the backslashes were not really necessary,
because the characters occur between `[` and `]`, but it is easier
to just escape them anyway, so you will not have to think about it.

##### ○•○

There are a few shortcuts for sets of characters that are needed
often.  The dot (`.`) can be used to mean 'any character that is
not a newline', an escaped 'd' (`\d`) means 'any digit', an escaped
'w' (`\w`) matches any alphanumeric character (including underscores,
for some reason), and an escaped 's' (`\s`) matches any white-space
(tab, newline, space) character.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
digitSurroundedBySpace = /\s\d\s/
show '1a 2 3d'.search digitSurroundedBySpace
~~~~

The escaped 'd', 'w', and 's' can be replaced by their capital
letter to mean their opposite. For example, `\S` matches any character
that is *not* white-space. When using `[` and `]`, a pattern can
be inverted by starting with a `^` character:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
notABC = /[^ABC]/
show 'ABCBACCBBADABC'.search notABC
~~~~

As you can see, the way regular expressions use characters to express
patterns makes them A) very short, and B) very hard to read.

#### *Exercise 32*

Write a regular expression that matches a date in the format
`'XX/XX/XXXX'`, where the `X`s are digits. Test it against the
string `'born 15/11/2003 (mother Spot): White Fang'`.

datePattern = /\d\d\/\d\d\/\d\d\d\d/
show 'born 15/11/2003 (mother Spot): White Fang'\
.search datePattern
~~~~

The backslash after the string continues the line after the line
break.

####

Sometimes you need to make sure a pattern starts at the beginning
of a string, or ends at its end. For this, the special characters
`^` and `$` can be used. The first matches the start of the string,
the second the end.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show /a+/.test 'blah'
show /^a+$/.test 'blah'
~~~~

The first regular expression matches any string that contains an
`a` character, the second only those strings that consist entirely
of `a` characters.

Note that regular expressions are objects, and have methods. Their
`test`[](#index-test) method returns a boolean indicating whether
the given string matches the expression.

The code `\b` matches a 'word boundary', which can be punctuation,
white-space, or the start or end of the string.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show /cat/.test 'concatenate'
show /\bcat\b/.test 'concatenate'

##### ○•○

Parts of a pattern can be allowed to be repeated a number of times.
Putting an asterisk ( `*` ) after an element allows it to be repeated
any number of times, including zero. A plus (`+`) does the same,
but requires the pattern to occur at least one time. A question
mark (`?`) makes an element 'optional' — it can occur zero or one
times.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
parenthesizedText = /\(.*\)/
show "Its (the sloth's) claws were gigantic!"\
.search parenthesizedText
~~~~

When necessary, braces can be used to be more precise about the
amount of times an element may occur. A number between braces (`{4}`)
gives the exact amount of times it must occur. Two numbers with a
comma between them (`{3,10}`) indicate that the pattern must occur
at least as often as the first number, and at most as often as the
second one. Similarly, `{2,}` means two or more occurrences, while
`{,4}` means four or less.

To make big regular expressions more readable CoffeeScript has
extended regular expressions. They are delimited by `///`[](#index-///)
and allow comments to be added to the different parts.  They ignore
formatting, so they can be split over several lines and placed in
a column.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
datePattern = /\d{1,2}\/\d\d?\/\d{4}/
show 'born 15/11/2003 (mother Spot): White Fang'\
.search datePattern

datePattern = ///
  \d{1,2}   # day
  /         # separator
  \d\d?     # month
  /         # separator
  \d{4}     # year
///
show 'born 15/11/2003 (mother Spot): White Fang'\
.search datePattern
~~~~

The pieces `/\d{1,2}/` and `/\d\d?/` both express 'one or two
digits'.

#### *Exercise 33*

Write a pattern that matches e-mail addresses. For simplicity,
assume that the parts before and after the `@` can contain only
alphanumeric characters and the characters `.` and `-` (dot and
dash), while the last part of the address, the country code or top
level domain after the last dot, may only contain alphanumeric
characters, and must be two or three characters long.

                      'but it didn wrok!'
show mailAddress.test 'the_giant_sloth@gmail.com'
~~~~

The `\b`s at the start and end of the pattern make sure that the
second string does not match.

####

Part of a regular expression can be grouped together with parentheses.
This allows us to use `*` and such on more than one character. For
example:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
cartoonCrying = /boo(hoo+)+/i
show "Then, he exclaimed 'Boohoooohoohooo'"\
.search cartoonCrying
~~~~

Where did the `i` at the end of that regular expression come from?
After the closing slash, 'options' may be added to a regular
expression. An `i`, here, means the expression is case-insensitive,
which allows the lower-case B in the pattern to match the upper-case
one in the string.

A pipe character (`|`) is used to allow a pattern to make a choice
between two elements. For example:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
holyCow = /(sacred|holy) (cow|bovine|bull|taurus)/i
show holyCow.test 'Sacred bovine!'
~~~~

##### ○•○

Often, looking for a pattern is just a first step in extracting
something from a string. In previous chapters, this extraction was
done by calling a string's `indexOf` and `slice` methods a lot. Now
that we are aware of the existence of regular expressions, we can
use the `match` method instead. When a string is matched against a
regular expression, the result will be `null` if the match failed,
or an array of matched strings if it succeeded.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
show 'No'.match /Yes/
show '... yes'.match /yes/
show 'Giant Ape'.match /giant (\w+)/i
~~~~

The first element in the returned array is always the part of the
string that matched the pattern. As the last example shows, when
there are parenthesized parts in the pattern, the parts they match
are also added to the array. Often, this makes extracting pieces
of a string very easy.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
quote = "My mind is a swirling miasma " +
        "(a poisonous fog thought to " +
        "cause illness) of titilating " +
        "thoughts and turgid ideas."
parenthesized = quote.match ///
  (\w+)    # Word
  \s*      # Whitespace
  \((.*)\) # Explanation
///
if parenthesized isnt null
  show "Word: #{parenthesized[1]} " +
       "Explanation: #{parenthesized[2]}"
~~~~

If you insert another set of parentheses in this example, then you
will see that the match stretches from the first to the last
parentheses. This is because the matching is greedy, it tries to
match as long a string as possible. You can change the `.*` to
`[^)]*` to prevent the match from stretching beyond the first closing
parentheses.


#### *Exercise 34*

Re-write the function `extractDate` that we wrote in [Data
Structures↑](#data-structures-objects-and-arrays). When given a
string, this function looks for something that follows the date
format we saw earlier. If it can find such a date, it puts the
values into a `Date` object. Otherwise, it throws an exception.
Make it accept dates in which the day or month are written with
only one digit.

           Number(found[1])
show extractDate \

~~~~

This version is slightly longer than the previous one, but it has
the advantage of actually checking what it is doing, and shouting
out when it is given nonsensical input. This was a lot harder without
regular expressions — it would have taken a lot of calls to `indexOf`
to find out whether the numbers had one or two digits, and whether
the dashes were in the right places.

####

The `replace`[](#index-replace) method of string values, which
we saw in [Functional Programming↑](#functional-programming),
can be given a regular expression as its first argument. `show
'Borobudur'.replace /[ou]/g, 'a'` Notice the `g` character after
the regular expression. It stands for 'global', and means that every
part of the string that matches the pattern should be replaced.
When this `g` is omitted, only the first `'o'` would be replaced.

Sometimes it is necessary to keep parts of the replaced strings.
For example, we have a big string containing the names of people,
one name per line, in the format “Lastname, Firstname”. We want to
swap these names, and remove the comma, to get a simple “Firstname
Lastname” format.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
names = '''Picasso, Pablo
Gauguin, Paul
Van Gogh, Vincent'''

show names.replace /([\w ]+), ([\w ]+)/g, '$2 $1'

# Non-printable characters can be tricky in regular
# expressions, actually all non-ASCII characters can
# be, they can be represented with their numeric codes:
# unicode \u0020 = hexadecimal \x20 = ascii #32 = ' '
show names.replace ///
  ([\w\x20]+)         # Lastname
  ,\u0020
  ([\w\x20]+)         # Firstname
///g, '$2 $1'
~~~~

The `$1` and `$2` in the replacement string refer to the parenthesized
parts in the pattern.  `$1` is replaced by the text that matched
against the first pair of parentheses, `$2` by the second, and so
on, up to `$9`.

If you have more than 9 parentheses parts in your pattern, this
will no longer work. But there is one more way to replace pieces
of a string, which can also be useful in some other tricky situations.
When the second argument given to the `replace` method is a function
value instead of a string, this function is called every time a
match is found, and the matched text is replaced by whatever the
function returns. The arguments given to the function are the matched
elements, similar to the values found in the arrays returned by
`match`: The first one is the whole match, and after that comes one
argument for every parenthesized part of the pattern.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
eatOne = (match, amount, unit) ->
  amount = Number(amount) - 1
  if amount is 1
    unit = unit.slice 0, unit.length - 1
  else if amount is 0
    unit = unit + 's'
    amount = 'no'
  amount + ' ' + unit

stock = '1 lemon, 2 cabbages, and 101 eggs'
stock = stock.replace /(\d+) (\w+)/g, eatOne
show stock
~~~~

#### *Exercise 35*

That last trick can be used to make the HTML-escaper from [Functional
Programming↑](#functional-programming) more efficient. You may
remember that it looked like this:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
escapeHTML = (text) ->
  replacements = [[/&/g, '&amp;']
                  [/"/g, '&quot;']
                  [/</g, '&lt;']
                  [/>/g, '&gt;']]
  forEach replacements, (replace) ->
    text = text.replace replace[0], replace[1]
  text
show escapeHTML '< " & " >'
~~~~

Write a new function `escapeHTML`, which does the same thing, but
only calls `replace` once.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# Compose a solution here
~~~~

##### View Solution
######

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
escapeHTML2 = (text) ->
  replacements =
    "<":  "&lt;"
    ">":  "&gt;"
    "&":  "&amp;"
    "\"": "&quot;"
  text.replace /[<>&"]/g, (character) ->
    replacements[character] ? character

show escapeHTML2 "The 'pre-formatted' tag " +
                "is written \"<pre>\"."
~~~~

The `replacements` object is a quick way to associate each character
with its escaped version. Using it like this is safe (i.e. no
`Dictionary` object is needed), because the only properties that
will be used are those matched by the `/[<>&"]/` expression.

####

There are cases where the pattern you need to match against is not
known while you are writing the code. Say we are writing a (very
simple-minded) obscenity filter for a message board. We only want
to allow messages that do not contain obscene words. The administrator
of the board can specify a list of words that he or she considers
unacceptable.

The most efficient way to check a piece of text for a set of words
is to use a regular expression. If we have our word list as an
array, we can build the regular expression like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
badWords = ['ape', 'monkey', 'simian', 'gorilla', 'evolution']
pattern = new RegExp badWords.join('|'), 'i'
isAcceptable = (text) ->
  !pattern.test text

show isAcceptable 'Mmmm, grapes.'
show isAcceptable 'No more of that monkeybusiness, now.'
~~~~

We could add `\b` patterns around the words, so that the thing about
grapes would not be classified as unacceptable. That would also
make the second one acceptable, though, which is probably not
correct. Obscenity filters are hard to get right (and usually way
too annoying to be a good idea).

The first argument to the `RegExp` constructor is a string containing
the pattern, the second argument can be used to add case-insensitivity
or globalness. When building a string to hold the pattern, you have
to be careful with backslashes. Because, normally, backslashes are
removed when a string is interpreted, any backslashes that must end
up in the regular expression itself have to be escaped:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
digits = new RegExp '\\d+'
show digits.test '101'
~~~~

##### ○•○

The most important thing to know about regular expressions is that
they exist, and can greatly enhance the power of your string-mangling
code.  They are so cryptic that you will probably have to look up
the details on them the first ten times you want to make use of
them. Persevere, and you will soon be off-handedly writing expressions
that look like occult gibberish.

When your tasks become too complex for regular expressions then
have a look at how CoffeeScript is implemented. It uses
[Jison](http://github.com/zaach/jison), a parser generator. With
it you define a grammar for the language you want your program to
be able to read i.e. parse. Jison then generates a module that can
read data in that format. You integrate the module in your program
and can then perform appropriate actions when different parts of
the data is read. It is an advanced tool, that begins where regular
expressions leave off.

### Modularity

This chapter deals with the process of organising programs.[^6] In small
programs, organisation rarely becomes a problem. As a program grows,
however, it can reach a size where its structure and interpretation
become hard to keep track of. Easily enough, such a program starts
to look like a bowl of spaghetti, an amorphous mass in which
everything seems to be connected to everything else.

[^6]: The main examples in this chapter show web and WebSocket
servers, to run them you have to install CoffeeScript with the book
source code, see [Quick CoffeeScript
Install](../literate/install-notes.html). It is optional and you
can follow along without running those examples. You can recognize
the examples that you can run in the browser; they have a line in
them with output below.

In top down design you look at the overall structure of your
application and divide it into smaller parts. There are many ways
to do this, one way is to distinguish between technical and application
specific areas.  For example instead of inserting statements that
write application activity in files in various places, the technical
part — writing in a file, checking for errors and handling daily
log roll-overs — can be placed in a logging utility as a technical
service.

A useful technique is to use a layered approach, where lower layers
do not know of higher layers. For example when communicating between
processes, lower level protocols can be encapsulated in a layer and
when data arrives — instead of a lower layer directly calling a
function to handle the data in a higher layer — the lower layer
raises an event[^X] that an interested higher layer can be listening
to. It is analogue to what we saw in [Error
Handling↑](#error-handling) where a failing function does not
have any knowledge of who or how an exception will be handled.

[^X]:  The system underlying standard CoffeeScript has an EventEmitter
to help you do this. Search for event in the documentation for the
runtime system you use to learn more.

When structuring a program in CoffeeScript, we do two things. We
separate it into smaller parts, called module[](#index-module)s,
each of which has a specific role, and we specify the relations
between these parts.

In [Searching↑](#searching), while finding routes, we made use
of a number of functions described in [Functional
Programming↑](#functional-programming). The chapter also defined
some concepts that had nothing in particular to do with route
planning, such as `flatten`, `partial` and the `BinaryHeap` type.
`BinaryHeap` was treated as a black box, we only had to know how
to use it, we did not have to know how it internally works. That
kind of encapsulation is the essence of modularity and of [Object
Orientation↑](#object-oriented-programming).

The `flatten` function was reused from the Underscore library. We
needed the `partial` function in a few places and haphazardly just
added it to the environment where we needed it. It would have been
easy to simply add `partial` to the Underscore library, but that
would mean that we had to add it every time a new version of
Underscore is released.

We could create our own module instead and place the missing parts
there, then we would have to refer to two libraries whenever we are
using fundamental functions. Or we could create a module with our
functions that include Underscore and use the functions from it to
build our own. Our module would then depend on Underscore. When a
module depend[](#index-depend)s on another module, it uses functions
or variables from that module, and will only work when the module
is loaded.

It is a good idea to make sure dependencies never form a circle.
Not only do circular dependencies create a practical problem (if
module `A` and `B` depend on each other, which one should be loaded
first?), it also makes the relation between the modules less
straightforward, and can result in a modularised version of the
spaghetti I mentioned earlier.

##### ○•○

Most modern programming languages have some kind of module system
built in. In CoffeeScript it sort of depends… In the standard
CoffeeScript environment we have a module system based on CommonJS
`require`. When using CoffeeScript in other environments, such as
on a page in a web browser, then we do not have `require` and must
rely on system specific services or once again invent something
ourselves[^Y].

[^Y]:  Projects such as
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) is aiming
at bringing `require` to the browser.

The most obvious way to start is to put every module in a different
file. This makes it clear which code belongs to which module. In
this chapter we will return to the *Seed of Life* example you saw
in the [Preface↑](#foreword) and make a server controlled,
animated version of it. For this purpose I have extracted the
mathematical calculations behind the drawing and placed them in a
file, `'10-MathFix.coffee'`. It contains a `CircularPosition` class
we can use to get positions about a ^1^⁄~6~ apart on a unit circle
and a fix for a floating point rounding error. It also uses the
prelude and has a small print utility at the end. It is not a module
yet, we will stepwise refine it so it can be used in both a server
and a browser environment.

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
require "./prelude"

Pi2 = Math.PI*2
# Create an array with angles on the unit circle.
angles = (angle for angle in [0...Pi2] by 1/3*Math.PI)
# Remove the last element if 2*PI were included
# due to floating point rounding on additions.
epsilon = 1e-14
lastAngle = angles[angles.length - 1]
# Use an interval to test floating point value
if Pi2 - epsilon < lastAngle < Pi2 + epsilon
  angles.length = angles.length - 1

class Point

# circle, offset by step if given non-zero.

    new Point Math.cos(angle), Math.sin(angle)

circ = new CircularPosition 0.01
for i in [0...6]
  show "#{i}: #{circ.nextPoint()}"
~~~~

The first thing is to remove the print utility at the end[^Z]. The
next is the `require './prelude'`, while the prelude has served us
well in the course of this book, it is not intended for modules.
The prelude includes a variety of definitions so we have been free
to focus on each aspect of CoffeeScript without distraction. However
it pulls these definitions into a shared namespace either directly
or via the `globalize` function (described later in this chapter).
This namespace is shared between all modules that a program consists
of and since the purpose of a module is for us to be able to reuse
it in various projects, a module should not 'pollute' this scarce,
shared resource. In other words, you can use the prelude, when you
are experimenting with a new algorithm, but do not use it when you
create a reusable module.

[^Z]:  How to use a separate test module is shown in [Binary
Heaps↓](#binary-heaps).

##### ○•○

When much code is loaded into an environment, it will use many
top-level variable names. Once there is more code than you can
really keep track of, it becomes very easy to accidentally use a
name that was already used for something else. This will break the
code that used the original value. The proliferation of top-level
variables is called name-space pollution[](#index-name-space-pollution),
and it has been a rather severe problem in JavaScript — the language
will not warn you when you redefine an existing variable.

CoffeeScript greatly reduces this problem by automatically encapsulating
modules. You only have to avoid directly using top-level variables.
In particular modules should not use top-level variables for values
that are not part of their external interface.

##### ○•○

In CoffeeScript, 'top-level' variables all live together in a single
place. In browsers, this place is an object that can be found under
the name `window`. The name is somewhat odd, `environment` or `top`
would have made more sense, but since browsers associate an environment
with a window or a 'frame', someone decided that `window` was a
logical name. In the standard CoffeeScript environment it is called
`global`.

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
show global.process.argv[0]
show global.console.log is console.log
show global.global.global.global.global.console
~~~~

As the third line shows, the name `global` is merely a property of
this environment object, pointing at itself.

##### ○•○

Not being able to define any internal functions and variables at all in
your modules is, of course, not very practical. Fortunately, there is a
trick to get around this. We could write all the code for the module
inside a function, and then add the variables that are part of the
module's interface to the top-level object. Because they were created in
the same parent function, all the functions of the module can see each
other, but code outside of the module can not. The wrapping in a
function is done by CoffeeScript automatically. In the server
environment, instead of assigning directly to the top-level environment
our module will export its definitions. In the browser we have to assign
to the top-level
`window`, which when a module is loaded by a browser is the same as
`this`. All we have to do is append this one line to our math module:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
(exports ? this).CircularPosition = CircularPosition
~~~~

If `exports`[](#index-exports) is defined then `CircularPosition`
is added to it otherwise it is added to the top-level environment
object. This change has been done in `'10-Circular.coffee'` and the
module is now usable from another module. The other definitions
such as the `Point` class are not visible to other modules. Objects
of `Point` type are of course visible as they are returned by
`nextPoint`. You can use this modular information hiding when
creating classes, if you want some definitions to be more private
than simply naming them with an `'_'` in front. We can verify this
in an ad-hoc test, this one is called `'10-CircularTest.coffee'`:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
cp = require "./10-Circular"
show = console.log

circ = new cp.CircularPosition 0.01
for i in [0...6]
  show "#{i}: #{circ.nextPoint()}"

try
  show "Instantiating a new Point:"
  p = new cp.Point 0, 0

The show function was defined in the prelude, so we no longer have
access to it. In the underlying environment there is a function
`console.log` that can be used for output. Instead of using
`console.log` directly, defining `show` as an alias for it makes
it easy to copy such code into another environment, the browser
were `console.log` does not exist. When we have many `show` calls,
we only have to change in one place to redirect them to `alert` or
debug output.

The process that we have been through — identifying a rounding
error, extracting the implementation into a separate module where
it is fixed — is called refactoring and it is an essential part of
developing applications. Looking through code and finding places
where it can be improved in functionality or in clarity results in
a better overall system.

Designing an interface for a module or an object type is one of the
subtler aspects of programming. On the one hand, you do not want
to expose too many details. They will only get in the way when using
the module. On the other hand, you do not want to be *too* simple
and general, because that might make it impossible to use the module
in complex or specialised situations.

Sometimes the solution is to provide two interfaces, a detailed
'low-level' one for complicated things, and a simple 'high-level'
one for straightforward situations. The second one can usually be
built very easily using the tools provided by the first one.

In other cases, you just have to find the right idea around which
to base your interface. The best way to learn the value of good
interface design is, unfortunately, to use bad interfaces. Once you
get fed up with them, you will figure out a way to improve them,
and learn a lot in the process. Try not to assume that a lousy
interface is 'just the way it is'. Fix it, or wrap it in a new
interface that is better.

##### ○•○

Just like an object type, a module has an interface. In
collection-of-functions modules such as Underscore, the interface
usually consists of all the functions that are defined in the module. In
other cases, the interface of the module is only a small part of the
functions defined inside it.

For example, our manuscript-to-HTML system from [Functional
Programming↑](#functional-programming) only needs an interface
of a single function, `renderFile`. The sub-system for building
HTML would be a separate module. For modules which only define a
single type of object, such as `Dictionary`, the object's interface
is the same as the module's interface.

##### ○•○

There are cases where a module will export so many variables that
it is a bad idea to put them all into the top-level environment.
In cases like this, you can do what the standard `Math` object does,
and represent the module as a single object whose properties are
the functions and values it exports. For example…

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
HTML =
  tag: (name, content, properties) ->
    name: name
    properties: properties
    content: content
  link: (target, text) ->
    HTML.tag 'a', [text], {href: target}
  # ... many more HTML-producing functions ...
~~~~

When you need the content of such a module so often that it becomes
cumbersome to constantly type `HTML`, you can always move it into
the top-level environment using a function like `globalize`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
# As defined in the prelude
globalize = (ns, target = global) ->
  target[name] = ns[name] for name of ns

globalize HTML, window?
show link 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/' +
  'download?doi=10.1.1.102.244&rep=rep1&type=pdf',
  'What Every Computer Scientist Should Know ' +
  'About Floating-Point Arithmetic'
~~~~

You can even combine the function and object approaches, by putting
the internal variables of the module inside a function, and having
this function return an object containing its external interface.

##### ○•○

When adding methods to standard prototypes, such as those of `Array`
and `Object` a similar problem to name-space pollution occurs. If
two modules decide to add a `map` method to `Array.prototype`, you
might have a problem. If these two versions of `map` have the precise
same effect, things will continue to work, but only by sheer luck.

##### ○•○

There are functions which require a lot of arguments. Sometimes
this means they are just badly designed, and can easily be remedied
by splitting them into a few more modest functions. But in other
cases, there is no way around it. Typically, some of these arguments
have a sensible 'default' value. We could, for example, write yet
another extended version of `range`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
range = (start, end, stepSize, length) ->
  if stepSize is undefined
    stepSize = 1
  if end is undefined
    end = start + stepSize * (length - 1)
  result = []
  while start <= end
    result.push start
    start += stepSize
  result
show range 0, undefined, 4, 5
~~~~

It can get hard to remember which argument goes where, not to mention
the annoyance of having to pass `undefined` as a second argument
when a `length` argument is used. We can make passing arguments to
this unfriendly function more comprehensive by wrapping them in an
object.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
defaultTo = (object, values) ->
  for name, value of values
    if not object.hasOwnProperty name
      object[name] = value

range = (args) ->
  defaultTo args, {start: 0, stepSize: 1}
  if args.end is undefined
    args.end = args.start +
               args.stepSize * (args.length - 1)
  result = [];
  while args.start <= args.end
    result.push args.start
    args.start += args.stepSize
  result
show range {stepSize: 4, length: 5}
~~~~

The `defaultTo` function is useful for adding default values to an
object. It copies the properties of its second argument into its
first argument, skipping those that already have a value.

For the *Seed of Life* from the [Preface↑](#foreword), to use
the `'10-Circular.coffee'` module in the web application, we have
a few things to do. First we can replace the first line with `kup
= require './prelude/coffeekup'`. The source code assigned to
`webpage` has a similar structure as the HTML we saw in [Functional
Programming↑](#functional-programming), but instead of being
object attributes or text, it is CoffeeScript function calls.

It is like we have HTML embedded as a language extension in
CoffeeScript. The correspondence between HTML and Coffeekup is
practically 1:1, so when you know which HTML tag you want to use
it is straightforward to write it in Coffeekup. You can find more
information on the [CoffeeKup website](http://coffeekup.org/) or
even better take the time to read the source code, it is only a few
hundred lines of CoffeeScript and quite readable. There are examples
in its standard distribution and [A Beginner's Introduction to
CoffeeKup by Mark Hahn](https://github.com/mark-hahn/coffeekup-intro/raw/master/coffeekup-intro-pandoc/coffeekup-intro.pdf).

In HTML5 there is a `canvas` tag with which you can create a drawing
area. Then you can draw with vector graphics commands on the area.
The commands are documented by W3C in [HTML Canvas 2D
Context](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/). If you are already
familiar with vector graphics then the [HTML5 Canvas Cheat
Sheet](http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas_sheet/HTML5_Canvas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
may be all you need to create your own drawings. When you choose
the technologies that you base your application on, then look for
vendor independent, standardized technologies first. They tend to
have a long lifespan, so you learn something you can bring with you
from task to task. An alternative to the W3C `canvas` is Adobe
Flash.

[](#index-script)Browsers load JavaScript files when they find a
`<script>` tag with an `src` attribute in the HTML of a web page.
The extension `.js` is usually used for files containing JavaScript
code. We could let the `coffee` command line compiler produce
JavaScript files for us. But then we have two files for every module
and someone is bound to forget to compile a file someday, which
could lead to strange behaviour and some difficult to find bugs.
So instead let's keep our CoffeeScript files and have the server
compile them on the fly. That means we let the web page request a
CoffeeScript file, but we will send the browser the corresponding
JavaScript.

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
script src: './10-Circular.coffee'
~~~~

Adding a `type: 'text/coffeescript'` attribute would tell the client
to expect and compile CoffeeScript code (if the CoffeeScript compiler
was loaded in the client). While that may sound like a good idea,
it has some problems. The biggest one is that the code is only
available after the code under the `coffeescript` function has run.
And that function is were we want to use the class from the imported
module. So forget about that possibility and compile on the server
instead.

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
circ = new CircularPosition()
for i in [0...6]
  pt = circ.nextPoint()
  circle ctx, x+100*pt.x, y+100*pt.y
~~~~

Replacing the loop that used *π* and trigonometric functions with
the one above is the last step for the client side. It is only a
few visible changes but we got rid of the rounding error, that fix
would have bloated the client with irrelevant details. Here is the
client from `'10-SeedLife.coffee'`:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
kup = require './prelude/coffeekup'

# Client-side web page with canvas
webpage = kup.render -> 
  doctype 5

    head ->

          circle = (ctx, x, y) ->
            ctx.beginPath()
            ctx.arc x, y, 100, 0, 2*Math.PI, false
            ctx.stroke()
          ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(255,40,20,0.7)'
          circle ctx, x, y
          circ = new CircularPosition()
          for i in [0...6]
            pt = circ.nextPoint()
            circle ctx, x+100*pt.x, y+100*pt.y
        window.onload = ->
          canvas = document.getElementById 'drawCanvas'
          context = canvas.getContext '2d'
          draw context, 300, 200

      header -> h1 'Seed of Life'

It is possible not use a `script` tag, but to fetch the content of
a file directly, and then use the `eval` function to execute it.
This makes script loading instantaneous, and thus easier to deal
with.  `eval`[](#index-eval), short for 'evaluate', is an interesting
function. You give it a string value, and it will execute the content
of the string as code.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
runOnDemand ->
  eval 'function IamJavaScript() {' +
       '  alert(\"Repeat after me:' +
       ' Give me more {();};.\");};' +
       ' IamJavaScript();'
~~~~

The global function will however only accept JavaScript, to get a
usable CoffeeScript `eval` function you need to refer to the
`'coffee-script'` library. In a browser it can be like this:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
runOnDemand ->
  CoffeeScript.eval 'alert ((a, b) -> a + b) 3, 4'
~~~~

It is similar in the server environment. But notice the `require`
statement — we are not interested in creating instances of the
`CoffeeScript` class, only in calling its static `eval` method —
so that line helps us avoid writing: `cs.CoffeeScript.eval`…

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
cs = (require 'coffee-script').CoffeeScript
cs.eval 'show ((a, b) -> a + b) 3, 4'
~~~~

You can imagine that `eval` can be used to do some interesting
things. Code can build new code, and run it. In most cases, however,
problems that can be solved with creative uses of `eval` can also
be solved with creative uses of anonymous functions, and the latter
is less likely to cause strange problems and security nightmares.
When `eval` is called inside a function, all new variables will
become local to that function.

A web server functions by responding to web browser (client) requests.
The minimal implementation given in *Seed of Life* create a server
that takes a function as an argument. Every time a request comes
in, the function is called. Such a function is called an event
handler or sometimes a callback. This function prints a message and
creates a response by writing a header, describing the content of
the response, and adding the web page as the response body. The
server is started by giving it a port number to listen to. The
server then goes to sleep, waiting for a client to request something
of it. You can do that by typing `http://localhost:3389/` in your
web browser[^AA]. To stop the server press `CTRL-C`. It's similar
to this:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
# Server-side HTTP server
http = require "http"
server = http.createServer (req, res) ->
  show "#{req.client.remoteAddress} " +
       "#{req.method} #{req.url}"
  res.writeHead 200, "Content-Type": "text/html"
  res.write webpage
  res.end()
server.listen 3389
show "Server running at"
show server.address()
~~~~

[^AA]:  Depending on your operating system you can also use numerical
IP addresses. `127.0.0.1` conventionally address your local machine.
In a `hosts` file you can map names into IP addresses, its location
depend on your operating system.

That is a bit too minimal for our *Seed of Life* application because
we have to send either the web page or our module depending on what
the client will be asking for. We could replace our code with a web
server framework but that is not very instructive, it only shows
you that something can be done, not how it works internally.

Instead lets expand the server with the minimum of what is required
to get it to work. You can reverse engineer the client/server
communication by adding a `show req` to the minimal server. Using
the new web page we can see that three items are requested by the
client:

Path                          Content
--------------------------    --------------------
`'/'`                         the web page,
`'/10-Circular.coffee'`       the code module, and
`'/favicon.ico'`              that we can ignore.
--------------------------    --------------------

That is enough information to add some if statements to it.

For the module request we have to read the file, compile it with
CoffeeScript (using the same module as `eval`) and return the
compiled code, that the browser can understand, in the response.
When a request is made for anything else then a simple response is
'not found', that's a `404` in HTTP.

If you looked in the prelude how it was reading a file, then that
is *not* the way to read a file in a server. The prelude uses a
synchronous function, that means that everything stops until the
file has been read.  In the world of servers hard disks are slow,
and one request should not stop other requests. Using `readFile`
solves this because its last argument is for a function that will
only be run when the file has been read — the server can then process
other requests in the meantime.

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
# Server-side HTTP server
show = console.log
http = require "http"
fs = require "fs"
cs = require("coffee-script").CoffeeScript

server = http.createServer (req, res) ->

       "#{req.method} #{req.url}"
  if req.method is "GET"
    if req.url is "/"

  res.writeHead 404, "Content-Type": "text/html"
  res.write "404 Not found"
  res.end()

~~~~

I think you can see that this code practically begs to be abstracted
and modularized. Instead of an `if` chain, we could have a function
with an object as argument where each attribute is a request and
each value a function to handle the request.  Then there is error
handling, if the file is not found then the server throws an error
and stops. The purpose of `'10-SeedLife.coffee'` is to show how you
can use a module on a web page, so refactoring and beautifying the
server is up to you[^BB].

[^BB]:  If you want to understand how to write your own HTTP server
then Manuel Kiessling has a [tutorial](http://www.nodebeginner.org/)
that you can easily translate into your own CoffeeScript web server.

Building a program as a set of nice, small modules often means the
program will use a lot of different files. When programming for the
web, having lots of small code files on a page tend to make the
page slower to load. This does not have to be a problem though. You
can write and test your program as a number of small files, and put
them all into a single big file when 'publishing' the program to
the web. The CoffeeScript compiler has a join feature for this.

##### ○•○

A module or group of modules that can be useful in more than one
program is usually called a library[](#index-library). For many
programming languages, there is a huge set of quality libraries
available. This means programmers do not have to start from scratch
all the time, which can make them a lot more productive.

For CoffeeScript, unfortunately, the number of available libraries
is not very large. But you can use JavaScript libraries as a stopgap.
Underscore is an example of a good library with its 'basic' tools,
things like `map` and `clone`. Other languages tend to provide such
obviously useful things as built-in standard features, but with
CoffeeScript you will have to either build a collection of them for
yourself or use a library.

Using a library is recommended: It is less work, and the code in a
library has usually been tested more thoroughly than the things you
write yourself. Some things to check when selecting a library is
functionality, adequate documentation, and readable source code —
and that the library is small enough that you can understand and
fix bugs in it — if need be on your own.

##### ○•○

Beyond the concept of modules and programs is the world of distributed
programming where processes running on different machines collaborate
on solving a task or interact with each other in near real time.
One protocol that enables distributed programming is
[WebSockets](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).

A WebSocket is a bi-directional, full-duplex communications channel
over a TCP socket. Possibly the same socket that a web server is
using. With bi-directional, full-duplex support a server and its
clients can send messages back and forth concurrently. It opens the
door to many kinds of web applications that would have been difficult
to implement over http.

Most of the latest web browsers have support for WebSockets. Some
have it disabled by default because of potential security issues
in the draft protocol, the prelude shows how to enable WebSocket
support in Firefox and Opera. It is enabled in Chrome and Safari.
To see if your web browser works with WebSockets you can run
`'10-TestWebSocket.coffee'`.

##### ○•○

To connect a client to a WebSocket server, you create a `WebSocket`
object with a server as its endpoint. Note the `ws` protocol instead
of `http`:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
websocket = new WebSocket 'ws://localhost:8080/'
~~~~

You can attach functions to a `WebSocket` object, so your code can
react when certain events occur. There are four of them:

- `onopen`
- `onclose`
- `onmessage`
- `onerror`

Sending a message to the server is done with `send`. For example:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
websocket.onopen = (evt) ->
  writeToScreen 'CONNECTED'
  websocket.send 'WebSocket works!'
~~~~

That is how simple it is with a client on a web page. In CoffeeScript's
server-side environment there is not yet support for WebSockets,
but that is easily fixed with the `ws` library from Jacek Becela.
It is less than 200 lines when translated into CoffeeScript. It is
present in the prelude or you can use it directly from `prelude/ws.coffee`.

To create a server you pass a function to its `createServer` method
and get a `websocket` object as an argument where you can attach
methods to listen for events.  To send a message to a client, call
its `write` method with a string. Here is an abbreviated use of it:

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
wsHandler = (websocket) ->
  websocket.on 'connect', (resource) ->
    show 'connect: ' + resource
    # ...
  websocket.on 'data', (data) ->
    show data                    # process data
    websocket.write 'Cowabunga!' # respond
  # ...

wsServer = ws.createServer wsHandler
wsServer.listen 8080
~~~~

way you like.

Through the examples, exercises and explanations you have a foundation
for your own projects: a collaborative web application, a multi-user
game, a library with an aesthetically pleasing implementation, …

First choose what your project is going to be about, then look to
[github](https://github.com/languages/CoffeeScript) for supporting
code and libraries. A couple of interesting ones for web applications
are [Zappa](https://github.com/mauricemach/zappa) and
[SocketStream](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream).

If you would like a broader foundation in computer science then
read: [Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer
Programming](http://cisnet.mit.edu/4i7o9/5cjhf/toc) by Peter van
Roy and Seif Haridi. Not a word of CoffeeScript, but plenty of
insight.

### Language extras

* * * * * * * * * *


Most of the CoffeeScript language has been introduced in Smooth
CoffeeScript. This appendix illustrates some extra language constructs
and idioms that may come in handy.

##### ○•○

There is a statement called `switch`[](#index-switch) which can
be used to choose which code to execute based on some value.
Alternatives include a chain of `if` statements or an associative
data structure.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
weatherAdvice = (weather) ->
  show 'When it is ' + weather
  switch weather
    when 'sunny'
      show 'Dress lightly.'
      show 'Go outside.'
    when 'cloudy'
      show 'Go outside.'
    when 'tornado', 'hurricane'
      show 'Seek shelter'
    else
      show 'Unknown weather type: ' + weather
weatherAdvice 'sunny'
weatherAdvice 'cloudy'
weatherAdvice 'tornado'
weatherAdvice 'hailstorm'
~~~~

Inside the block opened by `switch`, you can write a number of
`when` labels. The program will jump to the label that corresponds
to the value that `switch` was given or to `else` if no matching
value is found. Then it executes statements in the following block
until it reaches the next `when` or `else` statement. Unlike some
other languages there is no fall-through between `when` cases and
no `break` statement is therefore needed. You can have a comma-separated
lists after a `when`, any of the values is then used to find a
match.

##### ○•○

Closely related to `break`, there is `continue`[](#index-continue).
They can be used in the same places. While `break` jumps *out* of
a loop and causes the program to proceed after the loop, `continue`
jumps to the next iteration of the loop.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
for i in [20...30]
  if i % 3 isnt 0
    continue
  show i + ' is divisible by three.'
~~~~

A similar effect can usually be produced using just `if`, but there
are cases where `continue` looks nicer.

##### ○•○

Pattern matching has been touched upon, a few more examples can
clarify the scope of it. You can assign an object to an anonymous
object with matching attribute names.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class Point
  constructor: (@x, @y) ->
pt = new Point 3, 4

{x, y} = pt
show "x is #{x} and y is #{y}"
~~~~

Attribute names can be inferred from an anonymous object.  A function
can have an anonymous object as argument and extract the attributes
as variables.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
firstName = "Alan"
lastName = "Turing"

name = {firstName, lastName}
show name

decorate = ({firstName, lastName}) ->
  show "Distinguished #{firstName} " +
       "of the #{lastName} family."
decorate name
~~~~

##### ○•○

Unicode can be used in identifiers. Letter forms that are very
similar to characters in the western alphabets should be avoided.
It can be difficult in internationally shared projects due to
different keyboard layouts, but useful in teaching math or in a
local language.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
pi = π = Math.PI
sphereSurfaceArea = (r) -> 4 * π * r * r
radius = 1
show '4 * π * r * r when r = ' + radius
show sphereSurfaceArea radius
~~~~

##### ○•○

Qualifying a `for` statement with a `when` clause can be used to
filter array or object elements on a logical condition. Great for
one-liners.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
evens = (n) -> i for i in [0..n] when i % 2 is 0
show evens 6

steppenwolf = 
  title:   'Tonight at the Magic Theater'
  warning: 'For Madmen only'
  caveat:  'Price of Admittance: Your Mind.'
  caution: 'Not for Everybody.'

stipulations = (text for key, text of steppenwolf \
  when key in ['warning', 'caveat'])
show stipulations
show ultimatum for ultimatum in stipulations \
  when ultimatum.match /Price/
~~~~

##### ○•○

Destructuring assignment can be used to swap or reassign variables.
It is also handy for extracting values or returning multiple values
from a function.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
tautounlogical = "the reason is because I say so"
splitStringAt = (str, n) ->
  [str.substring(0,n), str.substring(n)]
[pre, post] = splitStringAt tautounlogical, 14
[pre, post] = [post, pre] # swap
show "#{pre} #{post}"
~~~~

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
[re,mi,fa,sol,la,ti] = [1..6]
[dal,ra...,mim] = [ti,re,fa,sol,la,mi]
show "#{dal}, #{ra} and #{mim}"

[key, word] = if re > ti then [mi, fa] else [fa, mi]
show "#{key} and #{word}"
~~~~

##### ○•○

A function can be bound to the `this` value that is in effect when
it is defined. This can be needed when you are using event handlers
or callback based libraries e.g. jQuery.  Instead of `->` use `=>`
to bind `this`.

In the following example the `a.display` would show `undefined`
when called in the `Container` if `display` was defined with `->`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
class Widget
  id: 'I am a widget'
  display: => show @id

class Container
  id: 'I am a container'
  callback: (f) ->
    show @id
    f()

a = new Widget
a.display()
b = new Container
b.callback a.display
~~~~

##### ○•○

With the `do` statement you can call a named or an anonymous function:

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
n = 3
f = -> show "Say: 'Yes!'"
do f
(do -> show "Yes!") while n-- > 0
~~~~

Which is reminiscent of the syntax for a function that takes a
function as its parameter.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
echoEchoEcho = (msg) -> msg() + msg() + msg()
show echoEchoEcho -> "No"
~~~~

The `do` statement captures the environment, so it is available
inside its block.  The `setTimeout` function calls the innermost
function after the loop has finished.  Without capture the `i`
variable is `4`.

~~~~ {.coffeescript}
runOnDemand ->
  for i in [1..3]
    do (i) ->
      setTimeout (-> show 'With do: ' + i), 0
  for i in [1..3]
    setTimeout (-> show 'Without: ' + i), 0
~~~~

### Binary Heaps

* * * * * * * * * *


In [Searching↑](#searching), the binary heap[](#index-binary-heap)
was introduced as a method to store a collection of objects in such
a way that the smallest element can be quickly found. As promised,
this appendix will explain the details behind this data structure.

Consider again the problem we needed to solve. The A\* algorithm
created large amounts of small objects, and had to keep these in
an 'open list'.  It was also constantly removing the smallest element
from this list. The simplest approach would be to just keep all the
objects in an array, and search for the smallest one when we need
it. But, unless we have a *lot* of time, this will not do. Finding
the smallest element in an unsorted array requires going over the
whole array, and checking each element.

The next solution would be, of course, to sort our array. CoffeeScript
arrays have a wonderful `sort`[](#index-sort) method, which can
be used to do the heavy work.  Unfortunately, re-sorting a whole
array every time an element is removed is more work than searching
for a minimum value in an unsorted array.  Some tricks can be used,
such as, instead of re-sorting the whole array, just making sure
new values are inserted in the right place so that the array, which
was sorted before, stays sorted. This is coming closer to the
approach a binary heap uses already, but inserting a value in the
middle of an array requires moving all the elements after it one
place up, which is still just too slow.

Another approach is to not use an array at all, but to store the
values in a set of interconnected objects. A simple form of this
is to have every object hold one value and two (or less) links to
other objects.  There is one root object, holding the smallest
value, which is used to access all the other objects. Links always
point to objects holding greater values, so the whole structure
looks something like this:

![figure ../img/tree-small.png](../img/tree-small.png)\


Such structures are usually called tree[](#index-tree)s, because
of the way they branch. Now, when you need the smallest element,
you just take off the top element and rearrange the tree so that
one of the top element's children — the one with the lowest value
— becomes the new top. When inserting new elements, you 'descend'
the tree until you find an element less than the new element, and
insert it there. This takes a lot less searching than a sorted array
does, but it has the disadvantage of creating a lot of objects,
which also slows things down.

##### ○•○

A binary heap, then, does make use of a sorted array, but it is
only partially sorted, much like the tree above. Instead of objects,
the positions in the array are used to form a tree, as this picture
tries to show:

![figure ../img/heap-small.png](../img/heap-small.png)\


Array element `1` is the root of the tree, array element `2` and
`3` are its children, and in general array element `X` has children
`X * 2` and `X * 2 + 1`. You can see why this structure is called
a 'heap'. Note that this array starts at `1`, while CoffeeScript
arrays start at `0`. The heap will always keep the smallest element
in position `1`, and make sure that for every element in the array
at position `X`, the element at `X / 2` (round down) is smaller.

Finding the smallest element is now a matter of taking the element
at position `1`. But when this element is removed, the heap must
make sure that there are no holes left in the array. To do this,
it takes the last element in the array and moves it to the start,
and then compares it to its child elements at position `2` and `3`.
It is likely to be greater, so it is exchanged with one of them,
and the process of comparing it with its children is repeated for
the new position, and so on, until it comes to a position where its
children are greater, or a position where it has no children.

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
[2, 3, 5, 4, 8, 7, 6]
# Take out 2, move 6 to the front.
[6, 3, 5, 4, 8, 7]
# 6 is greater than its first child 3, so swap them.
[3, 6, 5, 4, 8, 7]
# Now 6 has children 4 and 8 (position 4 and 5).
# It is greater than 4, so we swap again.
[3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7]
# 6 is in position 4, and has no more children.
# The heap is in order again.
~~~~

Similarly, when an element has to be added to the heap, it is put
at the end of the array and allowed to 'bubble' up by repeatedly
exchanging it with its parent, until we find a parent that is less
than the new node.

~~~~ {.COFFEESCRIPT}
[3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7]
# Element 2 gets added again, it starts at the back.
[3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 2]
# 2 is in position 7, its parent is at 3, which
# is a 5. 5 is greater than 2, so we swap.
[3, 4, 2, 6, 8, 7, 5]
# The parent of position 3 is position 1.
# Again, we swap.
[2, 4, 3, 6, 8, 7, 5]
# The element can not go further than position 1,
# so we are done.
~~~~

Note how adding or inserting an element does not require it to be
compared with every element in the array. In fact, because the jumps
between parents and children get bigger as the array gets bigger,
this advantage is especially large when we have a lot of elements[^CC].

[^CC]:  The amount of comparisons and swaps that are needed — in
the worst case — can be approached by taking the logarithm (base 2)
of the amount of elements in the heap.

##### ○•○

Here is the full code of a binary heap implementation. Two things
to note are that, instead of directly comparing the elements put
into the heap, a function (`scoreFunction`) is first applied to
them, so that it becomes possible to store objects that can not be
directly compared. The default is the identity function.

Also, because CoffeeScript arrays start at `0`, and the parent/child
calculations use a system that starts at `1`, there are a few strange
calculations to compensate.

The source code and the results are quite similar. On my machine
the time for CoffeeScript is about 0.41s and around 1.03s for
CPython. You can try it yourself with `coffee A3-Microbench.coffee`
and if you have CPython installed `python A3-Microtest.py`. C++ is
10 × to 30 × faster.

Below you can find implementations[^DD] for the classic 8 queens
problem.  The objective is to place eight queens on a chessboard
without any of the queens occupying the same row, column or diagonal.
The two implementations use the same algorithm and produce the same
results.  Timing for CPython 0.27s and for CoffeeScript 0.06s.

### Command Line Utility

* * * * * * * * * *


The utility used to remove solutions from source files is shown
here.  Partly as an example of a command line program, partly to
make this book and its accompanying source code self-containing.

The program uses the asynchronous file system functions in the same
manner as server programs. The synchronous functions are more
conventional, but less illustrative.

Also available as a two page [Quick
Reference](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/CoffeeScript%20Quick%20Ref.pdf)
in pdf format.

Refer to [coffeescript.org](http://coffeescript.org) for further
reference material and examples.

**General**

-   Whitespace is significant
-   Ending a line will terminate expressions - no need to use semicolons
-   Semicolons can be used to fit multiple expressions onto a single
    line
-   Use indentation instead of curly braces `{ }`
    to surround blocks of code in functions, `if`
    statements, `switch`, and `try/catch`
-   Comments starts with `#`
    and run to the end of the line

**Embedded JavaScript**

-   Use backquotes `` to embed JavaScript code within CoffeeScript

**Functions**

-   Functions are defined by an optional list of parameters in
    parentheses, an arrow, and an optional function body. The empty
    function looks like: `->`
-   Mostly no need to use parentheses to invoke a function if it is
    passed arguments. The implicit call wraps forward to the end of the
    line or block expression.
-   Functions may have default values for arguments. Override the
    default value by passing a non-null argument.

**Objects and arrays**

-   Objects and arrays are similar to JavaScript
-   When each property is listed on its own line, the commas are
    optional
-   Objects may be created using indentation instead of explicit braces,
    similar to YAML
-   Reserved words, like `class`, can be used as properties of an
    object without quoting them as strings

**Lexical Scoping and Variable Safety**

-   Variables are declared implicitly when used (no `var` keyword).
-   The compiler ensures that variables are declared within lexical
    scope. An outer variable is not redeclared within an inner function
    when it is in scope
-   Using an inner variable can not shadow an outer variable, only refer
    to it. So avoid reusing the name of an external variable in a deeply
    nested function
-   CoffeeScript output is wrapped in an anonymous function, making it
    difficult to accidentally pollute the global namespace
-   To create top-level variables for other scripts, attach them as
    properties on `window`, or to `exports` in CommonJS. Use: `exports ? this`

**If, Else, Unless, and Conditional Assignment**

-   `if/else` can be written without parentheses and curly braces
-   Multi-line conditionals are delimited by indentation
-   `if` and `unless`
    can be used in postfix form i.e. at the end of the statement
-   `if` statements can be used as expressions. No need for `?:`

**Splats**

-   Splats `...` can be used instead of the variable number of
    `arguments` object and are available for both function definition
    and invocation

**Loops and Comprehensions**

-   Comprehensions `for ... in` work over arrays, objects, and ranges
-   Comprehensions replace for loops, with optional guard clauses and
    the value of the current array index: `for value, index in array`
-   Array comprehensions are expressions, and can be returned and
    assigned
-   Comprehensions may replace `each/forEach`, `map` or `select/filter`
-   Use a range when the start and end of a loop is known (integer steps)
-   Use `by` to step in fixed-size increments
-   When assigning the value of a comprehension to a variable,
    CoffeeScript collects the result of each iteration into an array
-   Return `null`, `undefined` or `true` if a loop is only for side-effects
-   To iterate over the key and value properties in an object, use `of`
-   Use: `for own key, value of object`
    to iterate over the keys that are directly defined on an object
-   The only low-level loop is the `while` loop. It can be used as an
    expression, returning an array containing the result of each
    iteration through the loop
-   `until` is equivalent to `while not`
-   `loop` is equivalent to `while true`
-   The `do` keyword inserts a closure wrapper, forwards any arguments
    and invokes a passed function

**Array Slicing and Splicing with Ranges**

-   Ranges can be used to extract slices of arrays
-   With two dots `[3..6]`, the range is inclusive (3, 4, 5, 6)
-   With three dots `[3...6]`, the range excludes the end (3, 4, 5)
-   The same syntax can be used with assignment to replace a segment of
    an array with new values, splicing it
-   Strings are immutable and can not be spliced

**Everything is an Expression**

-   Functions return their final value
-   The return value is fetched from each branch of execution
-   Return early from a function body by using an explicit `return`
-   Variable declarations are at the top of the scope, so assignment
    can be used within expressions, even for variables that have
    not been seen before
-   Statements, when used as part of an expression, are converted into
    expressions with a closure wrapper. This allows assignment of the
    result of a comprehension to a variable
-   The following are not expressions: `break`, `continue`, and `return`

**Operators and Aliases**

-   CoffeeScript compiles `==` into `===`, and `!=` into `!==`.
    There is no equivalent to the JavaScript `==` operator
-   The alias `is` is equivalent to `===`, and `isnt` corresponds to `!==`
-   `not` is an alias for `!`
-   Logical operator aliases: `and` is `&&`, `or` is `||`
-   In `while`, `if/else` and `switch/when` statements the `then`
    keyword can be used to keep the body on the same line
-   Alias for boolean `true` is `on` and `yes` (as in YAML)
-   Alias for boolean `false` is `off` and `no`
-   For single-line statements, `unless` can be used as the inverse of `if`
-   Use `@property` instead of `this.property`
-   Use `in` to test for array presence
-   Use `of` to test for object-key presence

**Existential Operator**

-   Use the existential operator `?` to check if a variable exists
-   `?` returns `true` unless a variable is `null` or `undefined`
-   Use `?=` for safer conditional assignment than `||=`
    when handling numbers or strings
-   The accessor variant of the existential operator `?.`
    can be used to soak up null references in a chain of properties
-   Use `?.` instead of the dot accessor `.` in cases where the
    base value may be `null` or `undefined`. If all of the properties
    exist then the expected result is returned, if the chain is broken,
    then `undefined` is returned instead

**Classes, Inheritance, and Super**

-   Object orientation as in most other object oriented languages
-   The `class` structure allows to name the class, set the
    superclass with `extends`, assign prototypal properties, and
    define a `constructor`, in a single assignable expression
-   Constructor functions are named as the `class` name,
    to support reflection
-   Lower level operators: The `extends` operator helps with proper
    prototype setup. `::` gives access to an object's prototype.
    `super()` calls the immediate ancestor's method of the same name
-   A class definition is a block of executable code, which may be used
    for meta programming.
-   In the context of a class definition, `this` is the class object
    itself (the `constructor` function), so static properties can be
    assigned by using `@property: value`, and functions defined in
    parent classes can be called with: `@inheritedMethodName()`

**Destructuring Assignment**

-   To make extracting values from complex arrays and objects
    convenient, CoffeeScript implements destructuring assignment
-   When assigning an array or object literal to a value, CoffeeScript
    breaks up and matches both sides against each other, assigning the
    values on the right to the variables on the left
-   The simplest case is parallel assignment `[a,b] = [b,a]`
-   It can be used with functions that return multiple values
-   It can be used with any depth of array and object nesting to get
    deeply nested properties and can be combined with splats

**Function binding**

-   The fat arrow `=>` can be used to define a function and bind it
    to the current value of `this`
-   This is helpful when using callback-based libraries, for creating
    iterator functions to pass to `each` or event-handler functions
    to use with `bind`
-   Functions created with `=>` are able to access properties of the
    `this` where they are defined

**Switch/When/Else**

-   The `switch` statement do not need a `break` after every case
-   A `switch` is a returnable, assignable expression
-   The format is: `switch` condition, `when` clauses,
    `else` the default case
-   Multiple values, comma separated, can be given for each
    `when` clause. If any of the values match, the clause runs

**Try/Catch/Finally**

-   `try/catch` statements are as in JavaScript (although they
    are expressions)

**String Interpolation, Heredocs, and Block Comments**

-   Single-quoted strings are literal. Use backslash for escape
    characters
-   Double-quoted strings allow for interpolated values,
    using `#{ ... }`
-   Multiline strings are allowed
-   A heredoc `'''` can be used for formatted or indentation-sensitive
    text (or to avoid escaping quotes and apostrophes)
-   The indentation level that begins a heredoc is maintained
    throughout, so the text can be aligned with the body of the code
-   Double-quoted heredocs `"""` allow for interpolation
-   Block comments `###` are similar to heredocs, and are preserved
    in the generated code

**Chained Comparisons**

-   Use a chained comparison `minimum < value < maximum`
    to test if a value falls within a range

**Extended Regular Expressions**

-   Extended regular expressions “heregexes” are delimited by
    `///` and are similar to heredocs and block comments
-   Extended regular expressions ignore internal whitespace and can
    contain comments
